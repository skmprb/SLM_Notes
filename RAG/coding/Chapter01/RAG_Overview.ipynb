            "system, but generally, it implies a structured way to handle data in vector\n",
            "form.  2. **Vectorized Data Points**:    - **Vectors**: In the context of data\n",
            "storage and processing, a vector is a mathematical representation of data in the\n",
            "form of an array of numbers. Each number in the array represents a dimension of\n",

            "numerical format that can be easily processed by machine learning algorithms.\n",
            "For example, text data can be vectorized using techniques like word embeddings\n",

            "point is represented as a vector in the vector store.  3. **Purpose and Use\n",

            "Data Points**:     - The primary feature of a vector store is that it contains\n",
            "data points that have been converted into vectors. These vectors are typically\n",
            "arrays of numbers that represent various attributes or features of the data.  2.\n",

            "meaning they can have many components. This allows for the representation of\n",
            "complex data structures and relationships.  4. **Scalability**:    - Vector\n",

            "to accommodate millions or even billions of vectors, making them suitable for\n",

            "of similar images or videos based on content.  3. **Natural Language\n",
