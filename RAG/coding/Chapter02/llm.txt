[ 1 ] While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy , predates reliable recorded history , it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries. [ 2 ] The early era of space exploration was driven by a " Space Race " in which the Soviet Union and the United States vied to demonstrate their technological superiority. Landmarks of this era include the launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth , the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1 , on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight ( Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1 ) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov ) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station ( Salyut 1 ) in 1971. In the 1970s, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program , and from competition to cooperation, the foremost example being the International Space Station (ISS), built between 1998 and 2011. [ 3 ] The 2000s brought advancements in the national space-exploration programs of China , the European Union , Japan , and India . The 2010s saw the rise of the private space industry in earnest with the development of private launch vehicles, space capsules, and satellite manufacturing. In the 2020s, the two primary global programs gaining traction are Moon-focused: the Chinese-led International Lunar Research Station and the U.S.-led Artemis Program , with its plan to build the Lunar Gateway and the Artemis Base Camp , each with a set of international partners. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] History of exploration [ edit ] See also: History of astronomy , Discovery and exploration of the Solar System , Timeline of space exploration , Timeline of first orbital launches by country , and Outer space § Discovery V-2 Rocket in the Peenemünde Museum First telescopes [ edit ] The first telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 in the Netherlands by an eyeglass maker named Hans Lippershey , but their first recorded use in astronomy was by Galileo Galilei in 1609. [ 7 ] In 1668 Isaac Newton built his own reflecting telescope , the first fully functional telescope of this kind, and a landmark for future developments due to its superior features over the previous Galilean telescope . [ 8 ] A string of discoveries in the Solar System (and beyond) followed, then and in the next centuries : the mountains of the Moon , the phases of Venus , the main satellites of Jupiter and Saturn , the rings of Saturn , many comets , the asteroids , the new planets Uranus and Neptune , and many more satellites . The Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2 was the first space telescope launched 1968, [ 9 ] but the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 [ 10 ] set a milestone. As of 1 December 2022, there were 5,284 confirmed exoplanets discovered. The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars [ 11 ] and more than 100 billion planets . [ 12 ] There are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] HD1 is the most distant known object from Earth, reported as 33.4 billion light-years away. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] First outer space flights [ edit ] Model of Vostok spacecraft Apollo Command Service Module in lunar orbit MW 18014 was a German V-2 rocket test launch that took place on 20 June 1944, at the Peenemünde Army Research Center in Peenemünde . It was the first human-made object to reach outer space , attaining an apogee of 176 kilometers, [ 21 ] which is well above the Kármán line . [ 22 ] It was a vertical test launch. Although the rocket reached space, it did not reach orbital velocity , and therefore returned to Earth in an impact, becoming the first sub-orbital spaceflight . [ 23 ] In 1949, the Bumper-WAC reached an altitude of 393 kilometres (244 mi), becoming the first human-made object to enter space, according to NASA . [ 24 ] First object in orbit [ edit ] The first successful orbital launch was of the Soviet uncrewed Sputnik 1 ("Satellite 1") mission on 4 October 1957. The satellite weighed about 83 kg (183 lb), and is believed to have orbited Earth at a height of about 250 km (160 mi). It had two radio transmitters (20 and 40 MHz), which emitted "beeps" that could be heard by radios around the globe. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere, while temperature and pressure data were encoded in the duration of radio beeps. The results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by a meteoroid . Sputnik 1 was launched by an R-7 rocket. It burned up upon re-entry on 3 January 1958. First human outer space flight [ edit ] The first successful human spaceflight was Vostok 1 ("East 1"), carrying the 27-year-old Russian cosmonaut , Yuri Gagarin , on 12 April 1961. The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe, lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes. Gagarin's flight resonated around the world; it was a demonstration of the advanced Soviet space program and it opened an entirely new era in space exploration: human spaceflight . First astronomical body space explorations [ edit ] The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 which reached the Moon in 1959. [ 25 ] The first soft landing on another celestial body was performed by Luna 9 landing on the Moon on 3 February 1966. [ 26 ] Luna 10 became the first artificial satellite of the Moon, entering in a lunar orbit on 3 April 1966. [ 27 ] The first crewed landing on another celestial body was performed by Apollo 11 on 20 July 1969, landing on the Moon. There have been a total of six spacecraft with humans landing on the Moon starting from 1969 to the last human landing in 1972. The first interplanetary flyby was the 1961 Venera 1 flyby of Venus , though the 1962 Mariner 2 was the first flyby of Venus to return data (closest approach 34,773 kilometers). Pioneer 6 was the first satellite to orbit the Sun , launched on 16 December 1965. The other planets were first flown by in 1965 for Mars by Mariner 4 , 1973 for Jupiter by Pioneer 10 , 1974 for Mercury by Mariner 10 , 1979 for Saturn by Pioneer 11 , 1986 for Uranus by Voyager 2 , 1989 for Neptune by Voyager 2 . In 2015, the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto were orbited by Dawn and passed by New Horizons , respectively. This accounts for flybys of each of the eight planets in the Solar System , the Sun , the Moon , and Ceres and Pluto (two of the five recognized dwarf planets ). The first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing of Venera 7 , which returned data to Earth for 23 minutes from Venus . In 1975, Venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet, returning images from Venus. In 1971, the Mars 3 mission achieved the first soft landing on Mars returning data for almost 20 seconds. Later, much longer duration surface missions were achieved, including over six years of Mars surface operation by Viking 1 from 1975 to 1982 and over two hours of transmission from the surface of Venus by Venera 13 in 1982, the longest ever Soviet planetary surface mission. Venus and Mars are the two planets outside of Earth on which humans have conducted surface missions with uncrewed robotic spacecraft . First space station [ edit ] Salyut 1 was the first space station of any kind, launched into low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1971. The International Space Station (ISS) is currently the largest and oldest of the 2 current fully functional space stations, inhabited continuously since the year 2000. The other, Tiangong space station built by China, is now fully crewed and operational. First interstellar space flight [ edit ] Voyager 1 became the first human-made object to leave the Solar System into interstellar space on 25 August 2012. The probe passed the heliopause at 121 AU to enter interstellar space . [ 28 ] Farthest from Earth [ edit ] The Apollo 13 flight passed the far side of the Moon at an altitude of 254 kilometers (158 miles; 137 nautical miles) above the lunar surface, and 400,171 km (248,655 mi) from Earth, marking the record for the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth in 1970. As of 9 February 2025 [update] , Voyager 1 was at a distance of 166.4 AU (24.89 billion km; 15.47 billion mi) from Earth. [ 29 ] It is the most distant human-made object from Earth. [ 30 ] Targets of exploration [ edit ] Starting in the mid-20th century probes and then human missions were sent into Earth orbit, and then on to the Moon. Also, probes were sent throughout the known Solar System, and into Solar orbit. Uncrewed spacecraft have been sent into orbit around Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury by the 21st century, and the most distance active spacecraft, Voyager 1 and 2 traveled beyond 100 times the Earth-Sun distance. The instruments were enough though that it is thought they have left the Sun's heliosphere, a sort of bubble of particles made in the Galaxy by the Sun's solar wind . The Sun [ edit ] The Sun is a major focus of space exploration. Being above the atmosphere in particular and Earth's magnetic field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations that cannot reach Earth's surface. The Sun generates most space weather , which can affect power generation and transmission systems on Earth and interfere with, and even damage, satellites and space probes. Numerous spacecraft dedicated to observing the Sun, beginning with the Apollo Telescope Mount , have been launched and still others have had solar observation as a secondary objective. Parker Solar Probe , launched in 2018, will approach the Sun to within 1/9th the orbit of Mercury. Mercury [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Mercury A MESSENGER image from 18,000 km showing a region about 500 km across (2008) Mercury remains the least explored of the Terrestrial planets . As of May 2013, the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER missions have been the only missions that have made close observations of Mercury. MESSENGER entered orbit around Mercury in March 2011, to further investigate the observations made by Mariner 10 in 1975 (Munsell, 2006b). A third mission to Mercury, scheduled to arrive in 2025, BepiColombo is to include two probes . BepiColombo is a joint mission between Japan and the European Space Agency . MESSENGER and BepiColombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by Mariner 10's flybys . Flights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or delta-v . Due to the relatively high delta-v to reach Mercury and its proximity to the Sun, it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable. Venus [ edit ] Main article: Observations and explorations of Venus Venus was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and, despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the Solar System, has had more landers sent to it (nearly all from the Soviet Union) than any other planet in the Solar System. The first flyby was the 1961 Venera 1 , though the 1962 Mariner 2 was the first flyby to successfully return data. Mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial bodies. In 1967, Venera 4 became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of Venus. In 1970, Venera 7 became the first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data. Starting in 1975, with the Soviet orbiter Venera 9 , some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to Venus, including later missions which were able to map the surface of Venus using radar to pierce the obscuring atmosphere. Earth [ edit ] Main article: Earth observation satellite First television image of Earth from space, taken by TIROS-1 (1960) Space exploration has been used as a tool to understand Earth as a celestial object. Orbital missions can provide data for Earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely ground-based point of reference. For example, the existence of the Van Allen radiation belts was unknown until their discovery by the United States' first artificial satellite, Explorer 1 . These belts contain radiation trapped by Earth's magnetic fields, which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000 km impractical. Following this early unexpected discovery, a large number of Earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore Earth from a space-based perspective. These satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of Earth-based phenomena. For instance, the hole in the ozone layer was found by an artificial satellite that was exploring Earth's atmosphere, and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify. Moon [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of the Moon Apollo 16 LEM Orion, the Lunar Roving Vehicle and astronaut John Young (1972) The Moon was the first celestial body to be the object of space exploration. It holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial object to be flown by, orbited, and landed upon by spacecraft, and the only remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans. In 1959, the Soviets obtained the first images of the far side of the Moon , never previously visible to humans. The U.S. exploration of the Moon began with the Ranger 4 impactor in 1962. Starting in 1966, the Soviets successfully deployed a number of landers to the Moon which were able to obtain data directly from the Moon's surface; just four months later, Surveyor 1 marked the debut of a successful series of U.S. landers. The Soviet uncrewed missions culminated in the Lunokhod program in the early 1970s, which included the first uncrewed rovers and also successfully brought lunar soil samples to Earth for study. This marked the first (and to date the only) automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to Earth. Uncrewed exploration of the Moon continues with various nations periodically deploying lunar orbiters. China's Chang'e 4 in 2019 and Chang'e 6 in 2024 achieved the world's first landing and sample return on the far side of the Moon . India's Chandrayaan-3 in 2023 achieved the world's first landing on the lunar south pole region. Crewed exploration of the Moon began in 1968 with the Apollo 8 mission that successfully orbited the Moon, the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans. In 1969, the Apollo 11 mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world. Crewed exploration of the Moon did not continue for long. The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 marked the sixth landing and the most recent human visit. Artemis II is scheduled to complete a crewed flyby of the Moon in 2025, and Artemis III will perform the first lunar landing since Apollo 17 with it scheduled for launch no earlier than 2026. Robotic missions are still pursued vigorously. Mars [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Mars Surface of Mars by the Spirit rover (2004) The exploration of Mars has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the Soviet Union (later Russia), the United States, Europe, Japan, and India. Dozens of robotic spacecraft , including orbiters , landers , and rovers , have been launched toward Mars since the 1960s. These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the Red Planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of Earth. The exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their missions, with some failing before they even began. Such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey, and has led researchers to jokingly speak of The Great Galactic Ghoul [ 31 ] which subsists on a diet of Mars probes. This phenomenon is also informally known as the " Mars Curse ". [ 32 ] In contrast to overall high failure rates in the exploration of Mars, India has become the first country to achieve success of its maiden attempt. India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] is one of the least expensive interplanetary missions ever undertaken with an approximate total cost of ₹ 450 Crore ( US$73 million ). [ 36 ] [ 37 ] The first mission to Mars by any Arab country has been taken up by the United Arab Emirates. Called the Emirates Mars Mission , it was launched on 19 July 2020 and went into orbit around Mars on 9 February 2021. The uncrewed exploratory probe was named "Hope Probe" and was sent to Mars to study its atmosphere in detail. [ 38 ] Phobos [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Phobos The Russian space mission Fobos-Grunt , which launched on 9 November 2011, experienced a failure leaving it stranded in low Earth orbit . [ 39 ] It was to begin exploration of the Phobos and Martian circumterrestrial orbit, and study whether the moons of Mars, or at least Phobos, could be a "trans-shipment point" for spaceships traveling to Mars. [ 40 ] Asteroids [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of the asteroids Asteroid 4 Vesta , imaged by the Dawn spacecraft (2011) Until the advent of space travel , objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes, their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery. Several asteroids have now been visited by probes, the first of which was Galileo , which flew past two: 951 Gaspra in 1991, followed by 243 Ida in 1993. Both of these lay near enough to Galileo' s planned trajectory to Jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost. The first landing on an asteroid was performed by the NEAR Shoemaker probe in 2000, following an orbital survey of the object, 433 Eros . The dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroid 4 Vesta , two of the three largest asteroids, were visited by NASA's Dawn spacecraft , launched in 2007. Hayabusa was a robotic spacecraft developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to return a sample of material from the small near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa to Earth for further analysis. Hayabusa was launched on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in mid-September 2005. After arriving at Itokawa, Hayabusa studied the asteroid's shape, spin, topography, color, composition, density, and history. In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid twice to collect samples. The spacecraft returned to Earth on 13 June 2010. Jupiter [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Jupiter Tupan Patera on Jupiter's moon Io The exploration of Jupiter has consisted solely of a number of automated NASA spacecraft visiting the planet since 1973. A large majority of the missions have been "flybys", in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit; such as in Pioneer and Voyager programs. The Galileo and Juno spacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planet's orbit. As Jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface, a landing mission is precluded. Reaching Jupiter from Earth requires a delta-v of 9.2 km/s, [ 41 ] which is comparable to the 9.7 km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit. [ 42 ] Fortunately, gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach Jupiter, albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration. [ 41 ] Jupiter has 95 known moons , many of which have relatively little known information about them. Saturn [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Saturn Saturn has been explored only through uncrewed spacecraft launched by NASA, including one mission ( Cassini–Huygens ) planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies. These missions consist of flybys in 1979 by Pioneer 11 , in 1980 by Voyager 1 , in 1982 by Voyager 2 and an orbital mission by the Cassini spacecraft, which lasted from 2004 until 2017. Saturn has at least 62 known moons , although the exact number is debatable since Saturn's rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying sizes. The largest of the moons is Titan , which holds the distinction of being the only moon in the Solar System with an atmosphere denser and thicker than that of Earth. Titan holds the distinction of being the only object in the Outer Solar System that has been explored with a lander, the Huygens probe deployed by the Cassini spacecraft. Uranus [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Uranus The exploration of Uranus has been entirely through the Voyager 2 spacecraft. However, there are plans for the Chinese Tianwen 4 mission to visit it or Callisto. [ 43 ] Given its axial tilt of 97.77°, with its polar regions exposed to sunlight or darkness for long periods, scientists were not sure what to expect at Uranus. The closest approach to Uranus occurred on 24 January 1986. Voyager 2 studied the planet's unique atmosphere and magnetosphere . Voyager 2 also examined its ring system and the moons of Uranus including all five of the previously known moons, while discovering an additional ten previously unknown moons. Images of Uranus proved to have a uniform appearance, with no evidence of the dramatic storms or atmospheric banding evident on Jupiter and Saturn. Great effort was required to even identify a few clouds in the images of the planet. The magnetosphere of Uranus, however, proved to be unique, being profoundly affected by the planet's unusual axial tilt. In contrast to the bland appearance of Uranus itself, striking images were obtained of the Moons of Uranus, including evidence that Miranda had been unusually geologically active. Neptune [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Neptune The exploration of Neptune began with the 25 August 1989 Voyager 2 flyby, the sole visit to the system. The possibility of a Neptune Orbiter has been discussed, but no other missions have been given serious thought. Although the extremely uniform appearance of Uranus during Voyager 2 ' s visit in 1986 had led to expectations that Neptune would also have few visible atmospheric phenomena, the spacecraft found that Neptune had obvious banding, visible clouds, auroras , and even a conspicuous anticyclone storm system rivaled in size only by Jupiter's Great Red Spot . Neptune also proved to have the fastest winds of any planet in the Solar System, measured as high as 2,100 km/h. [ 44 ] Voyager 2 also examined Neptune's ring and moon system . It discovered 900 complete rings and additional partial ring "arcs" around Neptune. In addition to examining Neptune's three previously known moons, Voyager 2 also discovered five previously unknown moons, one of which, Proteus , proved to be the last largest moon in the system. Data from Voyager 2 supported the view that Neptune's largest moon, Triton , is a captured Kuiper belt object. [ 45 ] Pluto [ edit ] Main article: Pluto § Exploration The dwarf planet Pluto presents significant challenges for spacecraft because of its great distance from Earth (requiring high velocity for reasonable trip times) and small mass (making capture into orbit difficult at present). Voyager 1 could have visited Pluto, but controllers opted instead for a close flyby of Saturn's moon Titan, resulting in a trajectory incompatible with a Pluto flyby. Voyager 2 never had a plausible trajectory for reaching Pluto. [ 46 ] After an intense political battle, a mission to Pluto dubbed New Horizons was granted funding from the United States government in 2003. [ 47 ] New Horizons was launched successfully on 19 January 2006. In early 2007 the craft made use of a gravity assist from Jupiter . Its closest approach to Pluto was on 14 July 2015; scientific observations of Pluto began five months prior to closest approach and continued for 16 days after the encounter. Kuiper Belt Objects [ edit ] The New Horizons mission also performed a flyby of the small planetesimal Arrokoth , in the Kuiper belt , in 2019. This was its first extended mission. [ 48 ] Comets [ edit ] Main article: List of missions to comets Comet 103P/Hartley (2010) Although many comets have been studied from Earth sometimes with centuries-worth of observations, only a few comets have been closely visited. In 1985, the International Cometary Explorer conducted the first comet fly-by ( 21P/Giacobini-Zinner ) before joining the Halley Armada studying the famous comet. The Deep Impact probe smashed into 9P/Tempel to learn more about its structure and composition and the Stardust mission returned samples of another comet's tail. The Philae lander successfully landed on Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko in 2014 as part of the broader Rosetta mission . Deep space exploration [ edit ] Main article: Deep space exploration This high-resolution image of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field includes galaxies of various ages, sizes, shapes, and colors. The smallest, reddest galaxies, are some of the most distant galaxies to have been imaged by an optical telescope. Deep space exploration is the branch of astronomy , astronautics and space technology that is involved with the exploration of distant regions of outer space. [ 49 ] Physical exploration of space is conducted both by human spaceflights (deep-space astronautics) and by robotic spacecraft . Some of the best candidates for future deep space engine technologies include anti-matter , nuclear power and beamed propulsion . [ 50 ] Beamed propulsion, appears to be the best candidate for deep space exploration presently available, since it uses known physics and known technology that is being developed for other purposes. [ 51 ] Future of space exploration [ edit ] Main article: Future of space exploration Concept art for a NASA Vision mission Artistic image of a rocket lifting from a Saturn moon Breakthrough Starshot [ edit ] Main article: Breakthrough Starshot Breakthrough Starshot is a research and engineering project by the Breakthrough Initiatives to develop a proof-of-concept fleet of light sail spacecraft named StarChip , [ 52 ] to be capable of making the journey to the Alpha Centauri star system 4.37 light-years away. It was founded in 2016 by Yuri Milner , Stephen Hawking , and Mark Zuckerberg . [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Asteroids [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of the asteroids An article in the science magazine Nature suggested the use of asteroids as a gateway for space exploration, with the ultimate destination being Mars. In order to make such an approach viable, three requirements need to be fulfilled: first, "a thorough asteroid survey to find thousands of nearby bodies suitable for astronauts to visit"; second, "extending flight duration and distance capability to ever-increasing ranges out to Mars"; and finally, "developing better robotic vehicles and tools to enable astronauts to explore an asteroid regardless of its size, shape or spin". Furthermore, using asteroids would provide astronauts with protection from galactic cosmic rays, with mission crews being able to land on them without great risk to radiation exposure. Artemis program [ edit ] Main article: Artemis program The Artemis program is an ongoing crewed spaceflight program carried out by NASA , U.S. commercial spaceflight companies , and international partners such as ESA , [ 55 ] with the goal of landing "the first woman and the next man" on the Moon, specifically at the lunar south pole region. Artemis would be the next step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually sending humans to Mars . In 2017, the lunar campaign was authorized by Space Policy Directive 1 , using various ongoing spacecraft programs such as Orion , the Lunar Gateway , Commercial Lunar Payload Services , and adding an undeveloped crewed lander. The Space Launch System will serve as the primary launch vehicle for Orion, while commercial launch vehicles are planned for use to launch other elements of the campaign. [ 56 ] NASA requested $1.6 billion in additional funding for Artemis for fiscal year 2020, [ 57 ] while the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee requested from NASA a five-year budget profile [ 58 ] which is needed for evaluation and approval by the U.S. Congress . [ 59 ] [ 60 ] As of 2024, the first Artemis mission was launched in 2022 with the second mission, a crewed lunar flyby planned for 2025. [ 61 ] Construction on the Lunar Gateway is underway with initial capabilities set for the 2025–2027 timeframe. [ 62 ] The first CLPS lander landed in 2024, marking the first US spacecraft to land since Apollo 17 . [ 63 ] Rationales [ edit ] Main article: Space advocacy Astronaut Buzz Aldrin had a personal Communion service when he first arrived on the surface of the Moon . The research that is conducted by national space exploration agencies, such as NASA and Roscosmos , is one of the reasons supporters cite to justify government expenses. Economic analyses of the NASA programs often showed ongoing economic benefits (such as NASA spin-offs ), generating many times the revenue of the cost of the program. [ 64 ] It is also argued that space exploration would lead to the extraction of resources on other planets and especially asteroids, which contain billions of dollars' worth of minerals and metals. Such expeditions could generate substantial revenue. [ 65 ] In addition, it has been argued that space exploration programs help inspire youth to study in science and engineering. [ 66 ] Space exploration also gives scientists the ability to perform experiments in other settings and expand humanity's knowledge. [ 67 ] Another claim is that space exploration is a necessity to humankind and that staying on Earth will eventually lead to extinction . Some of the reasons are lack of natural resources, comets, nuclear war, and worldwide epidemic. Stephen Hawking , renowned British theoretical physicist, said, "I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I'm an optimist. We will reach out to the stars." [ 68 ] Author Arthur C. Clarke (1950) presented a summary of motivations for the human exploration of space in his non-fiction semi-technical monograph Interplanetary Flight . [ 69 ] He argued that humanity's choice is essentially between expansion off Earth into space, versus cultural (and eventually biological) stagnation and death. These motivations could be attributed to one of the first rocket scientists in NASA, Wernher von Braun , and his vision of humans moving beyond Earth. The basis of this plan was to: Develop multi-stage rockets capable of placing satellites, animals, and humans in space. Development of large, winged reusable spacecraft capable of carrying humans and equipment into Earth orbit in a way that made space access routine and cost-effective. Construction of a large, permanently occupied space station to be used as a platform both to observe Earth and from which to launch deep space expeditions. Launching the first human flights around the Moon, leading to the first landings of humans on the Moon, with the intent of exploring that body and establishing permanent lunar bases. Assembly and fueling of spaceships in Earth orbit for the purpose of sending humans to Mars with the intent of eventually colonizing that planet. [ 70 ] Known as the Von Braun Paradigm, the plan was formulated to lead humans in the exploration of space. Von Braun's vision of human space exploration served as the model for efforts in space exploration well into the twenty-first century, with NASA incorporating this approach into the majority of their projects. [ 70 ] The steps were followed out of order, as seen by the Apollo program reaching the moon before the space shuttle program was started, which in turn was used to complete the International Space Station. Von Braun's Paradigm formed NASA's drive for human exploration, in the hopes that humans discover the far reaches of the universe. NASA has produced a series of public service announcement videos supporting the concept of space exploration. [ 71 ] Overall, the U.S. public remains largely supportive of both crewed and uncrewed space exploration. According to an Associated Press Poll conducted in July 2003, 71% of U.S. citizens agreed with the statement that the space program is "a good investment", compared to 21% who did not. [ 72 ] Human nature [ edit ] Space advocacy and space policy [ 73 ] regularly invokes exploration as a human nature . [ 74 ] Topics [ edit ] Main articles: Space science and Human presence in space Spaceflight [ edit ] Main articles: Spaceflight and Astronautics Delta-v's in km/s for various orbital maneuvers Spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space. Spaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications . Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories , reconnaissance satellites and other Earth observation satellites . A spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch , which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics . Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry , and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact. Satellites [ edit ] Main article: Satellite Satellites are used for a large number of purposes. Common types include military (spy) and civilian Earth observation satellites, communication satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and research satellites. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites. Commercialization of space [ edit ] Main article: Commercialization of space The commercialization of space first started out with the launching of private satellites by NASA or other space agencies. Current examples of the commercial satellite use of space include satellite navigation systems , satellite television, satellite communications (such as internet services) and satellite radio . The next step of commercialization of space was seen as human spaceflight. Flying humans safely to and from space had become routine to NASA and Russia. [ 75 ] Reusable spacecraft were an entirely new engineering challenge, something only seen in novels and films like Star Trek and War of the Worlds. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin supported the use of making a reusable vehicle like the space shuttle. Aldrin held that reusable spacecraft were the key in making space travel affordable, stating that the use of "passenger space travel is a huge potential market big enough to justify the creation of reusable launch vehicles". [ 76 ] Space tourism is a next step in the use of reusable vehicles in the commercialization of space. The purpose of this form of space travel is personal pleasure. Private spaceflight companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin , and commercial space stations such as the Axiom Space and the Bigelow Commercial Space Station have changed the cost and overall landscape of space exploration, and are expected to continue to do so in the near future. Alien life [ edit ] Main articles: Astrobiology and Extraterrestrial life Astrobiology is the interdisciplinary study of life in the universe, combining aspects of astronomy , biology and geology. [ 77 ] It is focused primarily on the study of the origin , distribution and evolution of life. It is also known as exobiology (from Greek: έξω, exo , "outside"). [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] The term "Xenobiology" has been used as well, but this is technically incorrect because its terminology means "biology of the foreigners". [ 81 ] Astrobiologists must also consider the possibility of life that is chemically entirely distinct from any life found on Earth. [ 82 ] In the Solar System, some of the prime locations for current or past astrobiology are on Enceladus, Europa, Mars, and Titan. [ 83 ] Human spaceflight and habitation [ edit ] Main articles: Human spaceflight , Bioastronautics , Effect of spaceflight on the human body , Space medicine , Space architecture , Space station , Space habitat (facility) , and Space habitat (settlement) Crew quarters on Zvezda , the base ISS crew module To date, the longest human occupation of space is the International Space Station which has been in continuous use for 25 years, 114 days. Valeri Polyakov 's record single spaceflight of almost 438 days aboard the Mir space station has not been surpassed. The health effects of space have been well documented through years of research conducted in the field of aerospace medicine . Analog environments similar to those experienced in space travel (like deep sea submarines), have been used in this research to further explore the relationship between isolation and extreme environments. [ 84 ] It is imperative that the health of the crew be maintained as any deviation from baseline may compromise the integrity of the mission as well as the safety of the crew, hence the astronauts must endure rigorous medical screenings and tests prior to embarking on any missions. However, it does not take long for the environmental dynamics of spaceflight to commence its toll on the human body; for example, space motion sickness (SMS) – a condition which affects the neurovestibular system and culminates in mild to severe signs and symptoms such as vertigo, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and disorientation – plagues almost all space travelers within their first few days in orbit. [ 84 ] Space travel can also have an impact on the psyche of the crew members as delineated in anecdotal writings composed after their retirement. Space travel can adversely affect the body's natural biological clock ( circadian rhythm ); sleep patterns causing sleep deprivation and fatigue; and social interaction; consequently, residing in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) environment for a prolonged amount of time can result in both mental and physical exhaustion. [ 84 ] Long-term stays in space reveal issues with bone and muscle loss in low gravity, immune system suppression, problems with eyesight, and radiation exposure. The lack of gravity causes fluid to rise upward which can cause pressure to build up in the eye, resulting in vision problems; the loss of bone minerals and densities; cardiovascular deconditioning; and decreased endurance and muscle mass. [ 85 ] Radiation is an insidious health hazard to space travelers as it is invisible and can cause cancer. When above the Earth's magnetic field, spacecraft are no longer protected from the sun's radiation; the danger of radiation is even more potent in deep space. The hazards of radiation can be ameliorated through protective shielding on the spacecraft, alerts, and dosimetry . [ 86 ] Fortunately, with new and rapidly evolving technological advancements, those in Mission Control are able to monitor the health of their astronauts more closely using telemedicine . One may not be able to completely evade the physiological effects of space flight, but those effects can be mitigated. For example, medical systems aboard space vessels such as the International Space Station (ISS) are well equipped and designed to counteract the effects of lack of gravity and weightlessness; on-board treadmills can help prevent muscle loss and reduce the risk of developing premature osteoporosis . [ 84 ] [ 86 ] Additionally, a crew medical officer is appointed for each ISS mission and a flight surgeon is available 24/7 via the ISS Mission Control Center located in Houston, Texas. [ 86 ] Although the interactions are intended to take place in real time, communications between the space and terrestrial crew may become delayed – sometimes by as much as 20 minutes [ 86 ] – as their distance from each other increases when the spacecraft moves further out of low Earth orbit; because of this the crew are trained and need to be prepared to respond to any medical emergencies that may arise on the vessel as the ground crew are hundreds of miles away. Many past and current concepts for the continued exploration and colonization of space focus on a return to the Moon as a "steppingstone" to the other planets, especially Mars. At the end of 2006, NASA announced they were planning to build a permanent Moon base with continual presence by 2024. [ 87 ] Beyond the technical factors that could make living in space more widespread, it has been suggested that the lack of private property , the inability or difficulty in establishing property rights in space, has been an impediment to the development of space for human habitation. Since the advent of space technology in the latter half of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky, with strong arguments both for and against. In particular, the making of national territorial claims in outer space and on celestial bodies has been specifically proscribed by the Outer Space Treaty , which had been, as of 2012 [update] , ratified by all spacefaring nations . [ 88 ] Space colonization, also called space settlement and space humanization, would be the permanent autonomous (self-sufficient) human habitation of locations outside Earth, especially of natural satellites or planets such as the Moon or Mars , using significant amounts of in-situ resource utilization . Human representation and participation [ edit ] See also: Space law Participation and representation of humanity in space is an issue ever since the first phase of space exploration. [ 89 ] Some rights of non-spacefaring countries have been mostly secured through international space law , declaring space the " province of all mankind ", understanding spaceflight as its resource, though sharing of space for all humanity is still criticized as imperialist and lacking. [ 89 ] Additionally to international inclusion, the inclusion of women and people of colour has also been lacking. To reach a more inclusive spaceflight, some organizations like the Justspace Alliance [ 89 ] and IAU featured Inclusive Astronomy [ 90 ] have been formed in recent years. Women [ edit ] Main article: Women in space The first woman to go to space was Valentina Tereshkova . She flew in 1963 but it was not until the 1980s that another woman entered space again. All astronauts were required to be military test pilots at the time and women were not able to join this career. This is one reason for the delay in allowing women to join space crews. [ 91 ] After the rule changed, Svetlana Savitskaya became the second woman to go to space, she was also from the Soviet Union . Sally Ride became the next woman in space and the first woman to fly to space through the United States program. Since then, eleven other countries have allowed women astronauts. The first all-female space walk occurred in 2018, including Christina Koch and Jessica Meir . They had both previously participated in space walks with NASA. The first woman to go to the Moon is planned for 2026. Despite these developments, women are underrepresented among astronauts and especially cosmonauts. Issues that block potential applicants from the programs, and limit the space missions they are able to go on, include: agencies limiting women to half as much time in space than men, arguing that there may be unresearched additional risks for cancer. [ 92 ] a lack of space suits sized appropriately for female astronauts. [ 93 ] Art [ edit ] See also: Space art § Art in space Artistry in and from space ranges from signals, capturing and arranging material like Yuri Gagarin 's selfie in space or the image The Blue Marble , over drawings like the first one in space by cosmonaut and artist Alexei Leonov , music videos like Chris Hadfield's cover of Space Oddity on board the ISS, to permanent installations on celestial bodies like on the Moon .

Robotic vehicle for Mars surface exploration This article is about autonomous exploration vehicles. For crewed vehicles on Mars, see Crewed Mars rover . NASA's Curiosity rover, selfie , 2015 A Mars rover is a remote-controlled motor vehicle designed to travel on the surface of Mars . Rovers have several advantages over stationary landers : they examine more territory, they can be directed to interesting features, they can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months, and they can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remote robotic vehicle control. They serve a different purpose than orbital spacecraft like Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter . A more recent development is the Mars helicopter . As of May 2021 [update] , there have been six successful robotically operated Mars rovers; the first five, managed by the American NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory , were (by date of Mars landing): Sojourner (1997), Spirit (2004–2010), Opportunity (2004–2018), Curiosity (2012–present), and Perseverance (2021–present). The sixth, managed by the China National Space Administration , is Zhurong (2021–2022). On January 24, 2016, NASA reported that ongoing studies on Mars by Opportunity and Curiosity would be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic , chemotrophic or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms , as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments ( plains related to ancient rivers or lakes ) that may have been habitable . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The search for evidence of habitability , taphonomy (related to fossils ), and organic carbon on Mars has become a primary NASA objective. [ 1 ] [ 6 ] The Soviet probes, Mars 2 and Mars 3 , were physically tethered probes; Sojourner was dependent on the Mars Pathfinder base station for communication with Earth; Opportunity , Spirit and Curiosity were on their own. As of April 27, 2025, Curiosity is still active, while Spirit , Opportunity , and Sojourner completed their missions before losing contact. On February 18, 2021, Perseverance , the newest American Mars rover, successfully landed.  On May 14, 2021, China's Zhurong became the first non-American rover to successfully operate on Mars. Missions [ edit ] See also: List of missions to Mars Active [ edit ] Curiosity of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission by NASA, was launched November 26, 2011 [ 7 ] [ 8 ] and landed at the Aeolis Palus plain near Aeolis Mons (informally "Mount Sharp") [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] in Gale Crater on August 6, 2012. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] The Curiosity rover is still operational as of 2025. Perseverance is NASA's rover based on the successful Curiosity design. Launched with the Mars 2020 mission on July 30, 2020, it landed on February 18, 2021. [ 16 ] It carried the Mars helicopter Ingenuity attached to its belly. Although Ingenuity 's mission has ended, Perseverance remains operational as of October 2025. Past [ edit ] Sojourner rover, Mars Pathfinder , landed successfully on July 4, 1997. Communications were lost on September 27, 1997. Sojourner had traveled a distance of just over 100 meters (330 ft). [ 17 ] Spirit (MER-A), Mars Exploration Rover (MER), launched on June 10, 2003, [ 18 ] and landed on January 4, 2004. Nearly six years after the original mission limit, Spirit had covered a total distance of 7.73 km (4.80 mi) but its wheels became trapped in sand. [ 19 ] The last communication received from the rover was on March 22, 2010, and NASA ceased attempts to re-establish communication on May 25, 2011. [ 20 ] Opportunity (MER-B), Mars Exploration Rover, launched on July 7, 2003 [ 18 ] and landed on January 25, 2004. Opportunity surpassed the previous records for longevity at 5,352 sols (5498 Earth days from landing to mission end; 15 Earth years or 8 Martian years) and covered 45.16 km (28.06 mi). The rover sent its last status on 10 June 2018 when a global 2018 Mars dust storm blocked the sunlight needed to recharge its batteries. [ 21 ] After hundreds of attempts to reactivate the rover, NASA declared the mission complete on February 13, 2019. Zhurong launched with the Tianwen-1 CNSA Mars mission on July 23, 2020, landed on May 14, 2021, in the southern region of Utopia Planitia , and deployed on May 22, 2021, while dropping a remote selfie camera on 1 June 2021. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Designed for a lifespan of 90 sols (93 Earth days), [ 24 ] Zhurong had been active for 347 sols (356.5 days) since its deployment and traveled on Mars's surface for 1,921 m (6,302 ft). [ 25 ] Since 20 May 2022, the rover was deactivated due to approaching sandstorms and Martian winter. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] But the larger-than-expected build-up of dust covering its solar panels prevented it from self-reactivation. On 25 April 2023, the mission designer Zhang Rongqiao announced that the buildup of dust from the last inactivation is greater than planned, indicating the rover could be inactive "forever". [ 28 ] Failed [ edit ] Mars 2 , PrOP-M rover, 1971, Mars 2 landing failed, destroying Prop-M with it. The Mars 2 and 3 spacecraft from the Soviet Union had identical 4.5 kilograms (9.9 lb) Prop-M rovers. They were to move on skis while connected to the landers with cables. [ 29 ] Mars 3 , PrOP-M rover, landed successfully on December 2, 1971. 4.5 kilograms (9.9 lb) rover tethered to the Mars 3 lander. Lost when the Mars 3 lander stopped communicating about 110 seconds after landing. [ 29 ] The loss of communication may have been due to the extremely powerful Martian dust storm taking place at the time, or an issue with the Mars 3 orbiter's ability to relay communications. Planned [ edit ] ESA's ExoMars rover Rosalind Franklin was confirmed technically ready for launch in March 2022 and planned to launch in September 2022, but due to the suspension of cooperation with Roscosmos this is delayed until at least 2028. A fast-track study was started to determine alternative launch options. [ 30 ] ISRO has proposed a Mars rover as part of Mars Lander Mission , its second Mars mission in 2030. [ 31 ] Proposed [ edit ] Mars Tumbleweed Rover , a spherical wind-propelled rover. The concept was first investigated by NASA in the early 2000s. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Since 2017, Team Tumbleweed has been developing a series of Tumbleweed Rovers. The research organization aims to land a swarm of 90 Tumbleweed rovers on the Martian surface by 2034. [ 34 ] Undeveloped [ edit ] Marsokhod was proposed to be a part of Russian Mars 96 mission. Astrobiology Field Laboratory , proposed in the 2000-2010 period as a follow on to MSL. [ 35 ] Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher (MAX-C), cancelled 2011 [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Mars Surveyor 2001 rover [ 38 ] The JAXA Melos rover was supposed to be launched in 2022. JAXA has not given an update since 2015.

NASA distinguishes between "mission" objectives and "science" objectives. Mission objectives are related to progress in space technology and development processes. Science objectives are met by the instruments during their mission in space. The science instruments are chosen and designed based on the science objectives and goals. The primary goal of the Spirit and Opportunity rovers was to investigate "the history of water on Mars". [ 39 ] The four science goals of NASA's long-term Mars Exploration Program are: Determine whether life ever arose on Mars Characterize the climate of Mars Characterize the geology of Mars Prepare for human exploration of Mars [ 40 ] Panorama of Husband Hill taken by the Spirit rover (November 2005) Gallery [ edit ] Mars rovers PrOP-M, failed Soviet rover NASA's Sojourner rover on Mars Comparison of wheels: Sojourner rover, MER (Opportunity and Spirit), Curiosity Comparison: MER, Sojourner rover, Curiosity Comparison: MER, Sojourner rover, humans, Curiosity Zhurong, first Chinese Mars rover Perseverance and Ingenuity Rosalind Franklin, planned ESA rover Comparison of the distances travelled by various Mars rovers See also [ edit ] Astrobiology Comparison of embedded computer systems on board the Mars rovers Crewed Mars rover InSight lander List of artificial objects on Mars List of missions to Mars List of rovers on extraterrestrial bodies Mars Exploration Rover Mars-Grunt Mars Pathfinder Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter 2001 Mars Odyssey Moon rover Lunar Roving Vehicle Radiation hardening Scientific information from the Mars Exploration Rover mission References [ edit ] ^ a b Grotzinger, John P.

Built by Lockheed Martin and operated by NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , the spacecraft was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on August 5, 2011 UTC , as part of the New Frontiers program . [ 7 ] Juno entered a polar orbit of Jupiter on July 5, 2016, UTC, [ 5 ] [ 8 ] to begin a scientific investigation of the planet. [ 9 ] After completing its mission, Juno was originally planned to be intentionally deorbited into Jupiter's atmosphere, [ 9 ] but has since been approved to continue orbiting until contact is lost with the spacecraft. [ 10 ] The FY2026 budget proposal from the second Trump administration would end the mission, however the continued funding for the mission is still being debated in the United States Congress . [ 11 ] If Juno mission receives a third mission extension, it will continue to explore Jupiter for another three years to study Jovian rings and inner moons area which is not well explored; [ 12 ] this phase will also include close flybys of the moons Thebe , Amalthea , Adrastea , and Metis . [ 13 ] Juno 's mission is to measure Jupiter's composition, gravitational field , magnetic field , and polar magnetosphere . It also searches for clues about how the planet formed, including whether it has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere, mass distribution , and its deep winds, which can reach speeds up to 620 km/h (390 mph). [ 14 ] Juno is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, after the RTG -powered Galileo orbiter , which orbited from 1995 to 2003. Unlike all earlier spacecraft sent to the outer Solar System and beyond—which used radioisotope thermoelectric generators for power— Juno is powered by solar panels, more commonly used by satellites orbiting Earth and working in the inner Solar System . [ 9 ] Accordingly, Juno required the three largest solar panel wings ever deployed on a planetary probe (at the time of launching). These play an integral role in stabilizing the spacecraft as well as generating power. [ 15 ] As of December 2025, Juno remained operational and in contact with Earth through the NASA Deep Space Network . [ 16 ] Naming [ edit ] Juno 's name comes from Greek and Roman mythology . The god Jupiter drew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief, and his wife, the goddess Juno , was able to peer through the clouds and reveal Jupiter's true nature. [ 17 ] A NASA compilation of mission names and acronyms referred to the mission by the backronym Jupiter Near-polar Orbiter . [ 18 ] However the project itself has consistently described it as a name with mythological associations [ 19 ] and not an acronym. The spacecraft's current name is in reference to the Roman goddess Juno . [ 17 ] Juno is sometimes called the New Frontiers 2 as the second mission in the New Frontiers program, [ 20 ] [ 21 ] but is not to be confused with New Horizons 2 , a proposed but unselected New Frontiers mission. Overview [ edit ] Juno 's interplanetary trajectory; tick marks at 30-day intervals. Juno spacecraft trajectory animation Animation of Juno 's trajectory from August 5, 2011 Juno · Earth · Mars · Jupiter Juno was selected on June 9, 2005, as the next New Frontiers mission after New Horizons . [ 22 ] The desire for a Jupiter probe was strong in the years prior to this, but there had not been any approved missions. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] The Discovery Program had passed over the somewhat similar but more limited Interior Structure and Internal Dynamical Evolution of Jupiter (INSIDE Jupiter) proposal, [ 24 ] and the turn-of-the-century era Europa Orbiter was canceled in 2002. [ 23 ] The flagship-level Europa Jupiter System Mission was in the works in the early 2000s, but funding issues resulted in it evolving into ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer . [ 25 ] Juno completed a five-year cruise to Jupiter, arriving on July 5, 2016. [ 8 ] The spacecraft traveled a total distance of roughly 2.8 × 10 ^ 9 km (19 AU; 1.7 × 10 ^ 9 mi) to reach Jupiter. [ 26 ] The spacecraft was designed to orbit Jupiter 37 times over the course of its mission. This was originally planned to take 20 months. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Juno 's trajectory used a gravity assist speed boost from Earth, accomplished by an Earth flyby in October 2013, two years after its launch on August 5, 2011. [ 27 ] The spacecraft performed an orbit insertion burn to slow it enough to allow capture. It was expected to make three 53-day orbits before performing another burn on December 11, 2016, that would bring it into a 14-day polar orbit called the Science Orbit. Because of a suspected problem in Juno 's main engine, the burn scheduled on December 11, 2016, was cancelled and Juno remained in its 53-day orbit until the first Ganymede encounter of its Extended Mission. [ 28 ] This extended mission began with a flyby of Ganymede on June 7, 2021. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Subsequent flybys of Europa and then Io decreased the orbital period to 33 days by February 2024. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] During the science mission, infrared and microwave instruments will measure the thermal radiation emanating from deep within Jupiter's atmosphere . These observations will complement previous studies of its composition by assessing the abundance and distribution of water, and therefore oxygen. This data will provide insight into Jupiter's origins. Juno will also investigate the convection that drives natural circulation patterns in Jupiter's atmosphere. Other instruments aboard Juno will gather data about its gravitational field and polar magnetosphere . The Juno mission was planned to conclude in February 2018 after completing 37 orbits of Jupiter, but now has been commissioned through 2025 to do a further 42 additional orbits of Jupiter as well as close flybys of Ganymede, Europa and Io. [ 33 ] The probe was then intended to be deorbited and burnt up in Jupiter's outer atmosphere [ 5 ] [ 6 ] to avoid any possibility of impact and biological contamination of one of its moons. [ 34 ] Flight trajectory [ edit ] Juno awaiting its launch in 2011 Launch [ edit ] Juno was launched atop an Atlas V ( 551 configuration ) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), Florida on August 5, 2011, 16:25:00 UTC. The Atlas V (AV-029) used a Russian-built RD-180 main engine, powered by kerosene and liquid oxygen . The main engine ignited and underwent checkout then, 3.8 seconds later, the five strap-on solid rocket boosters (SRBs) ignited. Following the SRB burnout, about 93 seconds into the flight, two of the spent boosters fell away from the vehicle, followed 1.5 seconds later by the remaining three. When heating levels had dropped below predetermined limits, the payload fairing that protected Juno during launch and transit through the thickest part of the atmosphere separated, about 3 minutes 24 seconds into the flight. The Atlas V main engine cut off 4 minutes 26 seconds after liftoff. Sixteen seconds later, the Centaur second stage ignited, and it burned for about 6 minutes, putting the satellite into an initial parking orbit . [ 35 ] The vehicle coasted for about 30 minutes, and then the Centaur was reignited for a second firing of 9 minutes, placing the spacecraft on an Earth escape trajectory in a heliocentric orbit . [ 35 ] Prior to separation, the Centaur stage used onboard reaction engines to spin Juno up to 1.4 r.p.m. About 54 minutes after launch, the spacecraft separated from the Centaur and began to extend its solar panels . [ 35 ] Following the full deployment and locking of the solar panels, Juno 's batteries began to recharge. Deployment of the solar panels reduced Juno 's spin rate by two-thirds. The probe is spun to ensure stability during the voyage and so that all instruments on the probe are able to observe Jupiter. [ 34 ] [ 15 ] The voyage to Jupiter took five years, and included two orbital maneuvers in August and September 2012 and a flyby of the Earth on October 9, 2013. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] When it reached the Jovian system , Juno had traveled approximately 19 astronomical units (2.8 billion kilometres). [ 38 ] Atlas V on launch pad Lift-off Launch video Deep space maneuvers and flyby of the Earth [ edit ] South America [ 39 ] as seen by JunoCam on its October 2013 Earth flyby Video of Earth and Moon taken by the Juno spacecraft After traveling for about a year in an elliptical heliocentric orbit, Juno performed two deep space maneuvers (DSMs), firing its engine twice near aphelion (beyond the orbit of Mars ) to change its orbit [ 40 ] and return to pass by the Earth at a distance of 559 kilometers in October 2013. [ 36 ] The combination of the DSMs and the resulting Earth flyby [ 41 ] helped Juno slingshot itself toward the Jovian system in a maneuver called a gravity assist . [ 42 ] The spacecraft received a boost in speed of more than 3.9 km/s (8,700 mph), and it was set on a course to Jupiter. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] The flyby was also used as a rehearsal for the Juno science team to test some instruments and practice certain procedures before the arrival at Jupiter. [ 43 ] Insertion into Jovian orbit [ edit ] Jupiter's gravity accelerated the approaching spacecraft to around 210,000 km/h (130,000 mph). [ 5 ] On July 5, 2016, between 03:18 and 03:53 UTC Earth-received time , an insertion burn lasting 2,102 seconds decelerated Juno by 542 m/s (1,780 ft/s) [ 45 ] and changed its trajectory from a hyperbolic flyby to an elliptical , polar orbit with a period of about 53.5 days. [ 46 ] The spacecraft successfully entered Jovian orbit on July 5, 2016, at 03:53 UTC. [ 4 ] Orbit and environment [ edit ] Juno 's elliptical orbit and the Jovian radiation belts Juno 's highly elliptical initial polar orbit takes it within 4,200 km (2,600 mi) of the planet and out to 8.1 × 10 ^ 6 km (5.0 × 10 ^ 6 mi), far beyond Callisto 's orbit. An eccentricity -reducing burn, called the Period Reduction Maneuver, was planned that would drop the probe into a much shorter 14 day science orbit. [ 47 ] Originally, Juno was expected to complete 37 orbits over 20 months before the end of its mission. Due to problems with helium valves that are important during main engine burns, mission managers announced on February 17, 2017, that Juno would remain in its original 53-day orbit, since the chance of an engine misfire putting the spacecraft into a bad orbit was too high. [ 28 ] Juno completed only 12 science orbits before the end of its budgeted mission plan, ending July 2018. [ 48 ] In June 2018, NASA extended the mission through July 2021. The orbits were carefully planned in order to minimize contact with Jupiter's dense radiation belts , which can damage spacecraft electronics and solar panels, by exploiting a gap in the radiation envelope near the planet, passing through a region of minimal radiation. [ 9 ] [ 49 ] The Juno Radiation Vault , with 1-centimeter-thick titanium walls (three times as thick as the Galileo spacecraft body's), also aids in protecting Juno 's electronics by reducing the incoming radiation by a factor of 800. [ 50 ] Despite the intense radiation, JunoCam and the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) were designed to endure at least eight orbits, while the Microwave Radiometer (MWR) was made to endure at least eleven orbits. All instruments are operational as of perijove 71. [ 51 ] Although the flux of electrons close to Jupiter is about ten times as high as it is around Jupiter's moon Europa, [ 52 ] Juno will still receive a lower total dose of radiation in its polar orbit (20 Mrad through end of mission) [ 53 ] than the Galileo orbiter received in its equatorial orbit. Galileo 's subsystems were damaged by radiation during its mission, including an LED in its data recording system. [ 54 ] Orbital operations [ edit ] Animation of Juno 's trajectory around Jupiter from June 1, 2016, to October 1, 2028 Juno · Jupiter Ganymede , photographed on 7 June 2021 by Juno during its extended mission The spacecraft completed its first flyby of Jupiter ( perijove 1) on August 26, 2016, and captured the first images of the planet's north pole. [ 55 ] On October 14, 2016, days prior to perijove 2 and the planned Period Reduction Maneuver, telemetry showed that some of Juno 's helium valves were not opening properly. [ 56 ] On October 18, 2016, some 13 hours before its second close approach to Jupiter, Juno entered into safe mode , an operational mode engaged when its onboard computer encounters unexpected conditions. The spacecraft powered down all non-critical systems and reoriented itself to face the Sun to gather the most power. Due to this, no science operations were conducted during perijove 2. [ 57 ] On December 11, 2016, the spacecraft completed perijove 3, with all but one instrument operating and returning data. One instrument, JIRAM, was off pending a flight software update. [ 58 ] Perijove 4 occurred on February 2, 2017, with all instruments operating. [ 28 ] Perijove 5 occurred on March 27, 2017. [ 59 ] Perijove 6 took place on May 19, 2017. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] Although the mission's lifetime is inherently limited by radiation exposure, almost all of this dose was planned to be acquired during the perijoves. As of 2017 [update] , the 53.4 day orbit was planned to be maintained through July 2018 for a total of twelve science-gathering perijoves. At the end of this prime mission, the project was planned to go through a science review process by NASA's Planetary Science Division to determine if it will receive funding for an extended mission. [ 28 ] In June 2018, NASA extended the mission operations plan to July 2021. [ 61 ] In January 2021, NASA extended the mission operations to September 2025. [ 62 ] In this phase Juno began to examine Jupiter's major moons , Ganymede , Europa and Io. A flyby of Ganymede occurred on June 7, 2021, 17:35 UTC , coming within 1,038 km (645 mi), the closest any spacecraft has come to the moon since Galileo in 2000. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 63 ] A flyby of Europa took place on September 29, 2022, at a distance of 352 km (219 mi). [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Juno performed two flybys of Io on December 30, 2023, and February 3, 2024, gathering observational data on volcanic activity. From April 2024, Juno will begin a series of experiments to learn more about Jupiter's interior shape and structure. [ 66 ] Planned deorbit and disintegration [ edit ] NASA originally planned to deorbit the spacecraft into the atmosphere of Jupiter after completing 32 orbits of Jupiter, but has since extended the mission to September 2025. [ 67 ] [ 62 ] The controlled deorbit is intended to eliminate space debris and risks of contamination of possible life-bearing moons (especially Europa) by surviving terrestrial microorganisms onboard the spacecraft in accordance with NASA's planetary protection guidelines. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Team [ edit ] Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio , Texas is the principal investigator and is responsible for all aspects of the mission. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California manages the mission and the Lockheed Martin Corporation was responsible for the spacecraft development and construction. The mission is being carried out with the participation of several institutional partners. Coinvestigators include Toby Owen of the University of Hawaii , Andrew Ingersoll of California Institute of Technology , Frances Bagenal of the University of Colorado at Boulder , and Candy Hansen of the Planetary Science Institute . Jack Connerney of the Goddard Space Flight Center served as instrument lead. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] Cost [ edit ] Juno was originally proposed at a cost of approximately US$700 million (fiscal year 2003) for a launch in June 2009 (equivalent to US$1225 million in 2025). NASA budgetary restrictions resulted in postponement until August 2011, and a launch on board an Atlas V rocket in the 551 configuration . As of 2019 [update] the mission was projected to cost US$1.46 billion for operations and data analysis through 2022. [ 73 ] Scientific objectives [ edit ] Jupiter imaged using the VISIR instrument on the Very Large Telescope , 2016. These observations helped to plan Juno's mission. [ 74 ] The Juno spacecraft's suite of science instruments will: [ 75 ] Determine the ratio of oxygen to hydrogen , effectively measuring the abundance of water in Jupiter, which will help distinguish among prevailing theories linking Jupiter's formation to the Solar System. Obtain a better estimate of Jupiter's core mass, which will also help distinguish among prevailing theories linking Jupiter's formation to the Solar System. Precisely map Jupiter's gravitational field to assess the distribution of mass in Jupiter's interior, including properties of its structure and dynamics. Precisely map Jupiter's magnetic field to assess the origin and structure of the field, and the depth at which the planet's magnetic field is created. This experiment will also help scientists understand the fundamental physics of dynamo theory . Map the variation in atmospheric composition, temperature, structure, cloud opacity and dynamics to pressures far greater than 100 bar (10 MPa; 1,500 psi) at all latitudes. Characterize and explore the three-dimensional structure of Jupiter's polar magnetosphere and auroras . [ 75 ] Measure the orbital frame-dragging , known also as Lense–Thirring precession caused by the angular momentum of Jupiter, [ 76 ] [ 77 ] and possibly a new test of general relativity effects connected with the Jovian rotation. [ 78 ] Scientific instruments [ edit ] The Juno mission's scientific objectives are being achieved with a payload of nine instruments on board the spacecraft: [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Microwave radiometer (MWR) [ edit ] Main article: Microwave Radiometer (Juno) Microwave Radiometer The microwave radiometer comprises six antennas mounted on two of the sides of the body of the probe. They will perform measurements of electromagnetic waves on frequencies in the microwave range: 600 MHz , 1.2, 2.4, 4.8, 9.6 and 22 GHz, the only microwave frequencies which are able to pass through the thick Jovian atmosphere. The radiometer will measure the abundance of water and ammonia in the deep layers of the atmosphere up to 200 bar (20 MPa; 2,900 psi) pressure or 500–600 km (310–370 mi) deep. The combination of different wavelengths and the emission angle should make it possible to obtain a temperature profile at various levels of the atmosphere. The data collected will determine how deep the atmospheric circulation is. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] The MWR is designed to function through orbit 11 of Jupiter. [ 86 ] (Principal investigator: Mike Janssen, Jet Propulsion Laboratory ) Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) [ edit ] Main article: Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper The spectrometer mapper JIRAM, operating in the near infrared (between 2 and 5 μm), conducts surveys in the upper layers of the atmosphere to a depth of between 50 and 70 km (31 and 43 mi) where the pressure reaches 5 to 7 bar (500 to 700 kPa). JIRAM will provide images of the aurora in the wavelength of 3.4 μm in regions with abundant H 3 + ions. By measuring the heat radiated by the atmosphere of Jupiter, JIRAM can determine how clouds with water are flowing beneath the surface. It can also detect methane , water vapor , ammonia and phosphine . It was not required that this device meets the radiation resistance requirements. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] The JIRAM instrument is expected to operate through the eighth orbit of Jupiter. [ 86 ] (Principal investigator: Alberto Adriani, Italian National Institute for Astrophysics ) JIRAM's  spin-compensation mirror is stuck since PJ44, but the instrument is operational. [ 90 ] Magnetometer (MAG) [ edit ] Main article: Magnetometer (Juno) MAG The magnetic field investigation has three goals: mapping of the magnetic field, determining the dynamics of Jupiter's interior, and determination of the three-dimensional structure of the polar magnetosphere. The magnetometer experiment consists of the Flux Gate Magnetometer ( FGM ), which will observe the strength and direction of the magnetic field lines, and the Advanced Stellar Compass ( ASC ), which will monitor the orientation of the magnetometer sensors. [ 81 ] (Principal investigator: Jack Connerney, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center ) Gravity Science (GS) [ edit ] Main article: Gravity Science (Juno) Gravity Science The purpose of measuring gravity by radio waves is to establish a map of the distribution of mass inside Jupiter. The uneven distribution of mass in Jupiter induces small variations in gravity all along the orbit followed by the probe when it runs closer to the surface of the planet. These gravity variations drive small probe velocity changes. The purpose of radio science is to detect the Doppler effect on radio broadcasts issued by Juno toward Earth in Ka-band and X-band , which are frequency ranges that can conduct the study with fewer disruptions related to the solar wind or Jupiter's ionosphere . [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 80 ] (Principal investigator: John Anderson, Jet Propulsion Laboratory ; Principal investigator (Juno's Ka-band Translator): Luciano Iess, Sapienza University of Rome ) Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment (JADE) [ edit ] Main article: Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment JADE The energetic particle detector JADE will measure the angular distribution, energy, and the velocity vector of ions and electrons at low energy (ions between 13 eV and 20 KeV, electrons of 200 eV to 40 KeV) present in the aurora of Jupiter. On JADE, like JEDI, the electron analyzers are installed on three sides of the upper plate which allows a measure of frequency three times higher.

JEDI has three identical sensors dedicated to the study of particular ions of hydrogen , helium , oxygen and sulfur .

It will also observe the interactions between Jupiter's atmosphere and magnetosphere . The instrument consists of two antennae that detect radio and plasma waves. [ 81 ] (Principal investigator: William Kurth, University of Iowa ) Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) [ edit ] Main article: UVS (Juno) Ultraviolet Spectrograph UVS will record the wavelength, position and arrival time of detected ultraviolet photons during the time when the spectrograph slit views Jupiter during each turn of the spacecraft. The instrument will provide spectral images of the UV auroral emissions in the polar magnetosphere. [ 81 ] (Principal investigator: G. Randall Gladstone, Southwest Research Institute ) JunoCam (JCM) [ edit ] Main article: JunoCam JunoCam A visible light camera/telescope, included in the payload to facilitate education and public outreach ; later re-purposed to study the dynamics of Jupiter's clouds, particularly those at the poles. [ 95 ] It was anticipated that it would operate through only eight orbits of Jupiter ending in September 2017 [ 51 ] due to the planet's damaging radiation and magnetic field, [ 86 ] [ 96 ] during Juno's 47th orbit, the imager began showing hints of radiation damage. By orbit 56, nearly all the images were corrupted; the cause was identified as a damaged voltage regulator. By annealing the camera at a temperature of 25 °C (77 °F), the camera was brought back to operations. Junocam undergoes this operation periodically and as of July 2025 remains in operation. [ 97 ] (Principal investigator: Michael C. Malin , Malin Space Science Systems ) Locations of Juno 's science instruments Interactive 3D model of Juno Operational components [ edit ] Satellite bus [ edit ] Juno 's satellite bus , its main electronics and propulsion box, is a hexagonal prism . [ 2 ] Solar panels [ edit ] Illumination test on one of Juno 's solar panels Juno is the first mission to Jupiter to use solar panels instead of the radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) used by Pioneer 10 , Pioneer 11 , the Voyager program , Ulysses , Cassini–Huygens , New Horizons , and the Galileo orbiter . [ 98 ] It is also the farthest solar-powered trip in the history of space exploration. [ 99 ] Once in orbit around Jupiter, Juno receives only 4% as much sunlight as it would on Earth , but the global shortage of plutonium-238 at the time, [ 100 ] [ 101 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ] as well as advances made in solar cell technology over the past several decades, makes it economically preferable to use solar panels of practical size to provide power at a distance of 5 a.u. from the Sun . [ 104 ] The Juno spacecraft uses three solar panels symmetrically arranged around the spacecraft. Shortly after it cleared Earth's atmosphere, the panels were deployed. Two of the panels have four hinged segments each, and the third panel has three segments and a magnetometer . Each panel is 2.7 by 8.9 m (8 ft 10 in by 29 ft 2 in) [ 105 ] providing 50 square metres (540 sq ft) of active cells [ 106 ] [ 107 ] – the largest on any NASA deep-space probe at the time of launching. [ 17 ] The combined mass of the three panels is nearly 340 kg (750 lb). [ 15 ] If the panels were optimized to operate at Earth, they would produce 12 to 14 kilowatts of power. Only about 486 watts were generated when Juno arrived at Jupiter, projected to decline to near 420 watts as radiation degrades the cells. [ 108 ] The solar panels will remain in sunlight continuously from launch through the end of the mission, except for short periods during the operation of the main engine and eclipses by Jupiter. A central power distribution and drive unit monitors the power that is generated by the solar panels and distributes it to instruments, heaters, and experiment sensors, as well as to batteries that are charged when excess power is available. Two 55 Ah lithium-ion batteries that are able to withstand the radiation environment of Jupiter provide power when Juno passes through eclipse. [ 109 ] Telecommunications [ edit ] Juno 's high-gain antenna dish being installed Juno uses in-band signaling ("tones") for several critical operations as well as status reporting during cruise mode, [ 110 ] but it is expected to be used infrequently. Communications are via the 34 m (112 ft) and 70 m (230 ft) antennas of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) utilizing an X-band direct link. [ 109 ] The command and data processing of the Juno spacecraft includes a flight computer capable of providing about 50 Mbit/s of instrument throughput. Gravity science subsystems use the X-band and K a -band Doppler tracking and autoranging. [ 111 ] Due to telecommunications constraints, Juno will only be able to return about 40 megabytes of JunoCam data during each 11-day orbital period, limiting the number of images that are captured and transmitted during each orbit to somewhere between 10 and 100 depending on the compression level used. [ 112 ] [ needs update ] The overall amount of data downlinked on each orbit is significantly higher and used for the mission's scientific instruments; JunoCam is intended for public outreach and is thus secondary to the science data. This is comparable to the previous Galileo mission that orbited Jupiter, which captured thousands of images [ 113 ] despite its slow data rate of 1000 bit/s (at maximum compression level) due to the failure of its high gain antenna . The communication system is also used as part of the Gravity Science experiment. [ 114 ] Propulsion [ edit ] Juno uses a LEROS 1b main engine with hypergolic propellant , manufactured by Moog Inc in Westcott, Buckinghamshire , England. [ 115 ] It uses approx. 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide for propulsion, including 1,232 kg (2,716 lb) available for the Jupiter Orbit Insertion plus subsequent orbital maneuvers. The engine provides a thrust of 645 newtons . The engine bell is enclosed in a debris shield fixed to the spacecraft body, and is used for major burns. For control of the vehicle's orientation ( attitude control ) and to perform trajectory correction maneuvers, Juno utilizes a monopropellant reaction control system (RCS) consisting of twelve small thrusters that are mounted on four engine modules. [ 109 ] Galileo plaque and minifigures [ edit ] Galileo Galilei plaque Juno carries a plaque to Jupiter, dedicated to Galileo Galilei . The plaque was provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and measures 7.1 by 5.1 cm (2.8 by 2.0 in). It is made of flight-grade aluminum and weighs 6 g (0.21 oz). [ 116 ] The plaque depicts a portrait of Galileo and a text in Galileo's own handwriting, penned in January 1610, while observing what would later be known to be the Galilean moons . [ 116 ] The text translates as: On the 11th it was in this formation – and the star closest to Jupiter was half the size than the other and very close to the other so that during the previous nights all of the three observed stars looked of the same dimension and among them equally afar; so that it is evident that around Jupiter there are three moving stars invisible till this time to everyone. The spacecraft also carries three Lego minifigures representing Galileo Galilei, the Roman god Jupiter , and his sister and wife, the goddess Juno . In Roman mythology, Jupiter drew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief. Juno was able to peer through the clouds and reveal Jupiter's true nature. The Juno minifigure holds a magnifying glass as a sign of searching for the truth, and Jupiter holds a lightning bolt. The third Lego crew member, Galileo Galilei, has his telescope with him on the journey. [ 117 ] The figurines were produced in partnership between NASA and Lego as part of an outreach program to inspire children's interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). [ 118 ] Although most Lego toys are made of plastic, Lego specially made these minifigures of aluminum to endure the extreme conditions of space flight. [ 119 ] Scientific results [ edit ] Among early results, Juno gathered information about Jovian lightning that revised earlier theories. [ 120 ] Juno provided the first views of Jupiter's north pole, as well as providing insight about Jupiter's aurorae, magnetic field, and atmosphere. [ 121 ] In 2021, analysis of the frequency of interplanetary dust impacts (primarily on the backs of the solar panels), as Juno passed between Earth and the asteroid belt, indicated that this dust, which causes the Zodiacal light , comes from Mars , rather than from comets or asteroids that come from the outer solar system, as was previously thought. [ 122 ] Juno made many discoveries that are challenging existing theories about Jupiter's formation. When Juno flew over the poles of Jupiter it imaged clusters of stable cyclones that exist at the poles. [ 123 ] It found that the magnetosphere of Jupiter is uneven and chaotic. Using its Microwave Radiometer, Juno found that the red and white bands that can be seen on Jupiter extend hundreds of kilometers into the Jovian atmosphere, yet the interior of Jupiter is not evenly mixed. This has resulted in the theory that Jupiter does not have a solid core as previously thought, but a "fuzzy" core made of pieces of rock and metallic hydrogen . This peculiar core may be a result of a collision that happened early on in Jupiter's formation. [ 124 ] In April 2020, Juno detected a meteor impact on Jupiter , with estimated mass of 250–5000 kg. [ 125 ] Results from Juno on storms suggests that they are far taller than expected, with some extending 60 miles (100 kilometers) below the cloud tops and others, including the Great Red Spot, extending over 200 miles (350 kilometers). With Juno traveling low over Jupiter's cloud deck at about 130,000 mph (209,000 kph) Juno scientists were able to measure velocity changes as small as 0.01 millimeter per second using a NASA's Deep Space Network tracking antenna, from a distance of more than 400 million miles (650 million kilometers). This enabled the team to constrain the depth of the Great Red Spot to about 300 miles (500 kilometers) below the cloud tops. The new results show that the cyclones are warmer on top, with lower atmospheric densities, while they are colder at the bottom, with higher densities. Anticyclones, which rotate in the opposite direction, are colder at the top but warmer at the bottom. [ 126 ] Timeline [ edit ] Date ( UTC ) Event Latitude (centric) [ 127 ] Longitude (Sys.

Ongoing NASA interstellar program A poster of the planets and moons visited during the Voyager program. The Voyager program is an American scientific program that employs two interstellar probes , Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 . They were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable planetary alignment to explore the two gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and potentially also the ice giants, Uranus and Neptune—to fly near them while collecting data for transmission back to Earth. After Voyager 1 successfully completed its flyby of Saturn and its moon Titan , it was decided to send Voyager 2 on flybys of Uranus and Neptune . [ 1 ] After the planetary flybys were complete, decisions were made to keep the probes in operation to explore interstellar space and the outer regions of the Solar System. On 25 August 2012, data from Voyager 1 indicated that it had entered interstellar space. [ 2 ] On 5 November 2019, data from Voyager 2 indicated that it also had entered interstellar space. [ 3 ] On 4 November 2019, scientists reported that on 5 November 2018, the Voyager 2 probe had officially reached the interstellar medium (ISM), a region of outer space beyond the influence of the solar wind , as did Voyager 1 in 2012. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] In August 2018, NASA confirmed, based on results by the New Horizons spacecraft, the existence of a " hydrogen wall " at the outer edges of the Solar System that was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] As of 2024, [update] the Voyagers are still in operation beyond the outer boundary of the heliosphere in interstellar space . Voyager 1 is moving with a velocity of 61,198 kilometers per hour (38,027 mph), or 17 km/s, (10.5 miles/second) relative to the Sun, and is 24,475,900,000 kilometers (1.52086 × 10 10 mi) from the Sun [ 10 ] reaching a distance of 162 AU (24.2 billion km ; 15.1 billion mi ) from Earth as of May 25, 2024. [ 11 ] As of 2024 [update] , Voyager 2 is moving with a velocity of 55,347 kilometers per hour (34,391 mph), or 15 km/s, relative to the Sun, and is 20,439,100,000 kilometers (1.27003 × 10 10 mi) from the Sun [ 12 ] reaching a distance of 136.627 AU (20.4 billion km ; 12.7 billion mi ) from Earth as of May 25, 2024. [ 11 ] The two Voyagers are the only human-made objects to date that have passed into interstellar space — a record they will hold until at least the 2040s — and Voyager 1 is the farthest human-made object from Earth. [ 13 ] History [ edit ] Further information: Grand Tour program Mariner Jupiter-Saturn [ edit ] See also: Grand Tour program § Mariner Jupiter-Saturn The trajectories that enabled the Voyager spacecraft to visit the outer planets and achieve velocity to escape the Solar System Plot of Voyager 2 ' s heliocentric velocity against its distance from the Sun, illustrating the use of gravity assist to accelerate the spacecraft by Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. To observe Triton , Voyager 2 passed over Neptune's north pole, resulting in an acceleration out of the plane of the ecliptic and reduced its velocity away from the Sun. [ 14 ] Voyager did things no one predicted, found scenes no one expected, and promises to outlive its inventors. Like a great painting or an abiding institution, it has acquired an existence of its own, a destiny beyond the grasp of its handlers. — Stephen J. Pyne [ 1 ] The two Voyager space probes were originally conceived as part of the Planetary Grand Tour planned during the late 1960s and early 70s that aimed to explore Jupiter , Saturn , Saturn's moon Titan , Uranus , Neptune , and Pluto . The mission originated from the Grand Tour program , conceptualized by Gary Flandro , an aerospace engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in 1964, which leveraged a rare planetary alignment occurring once every 175 years. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] This alignment allowed a craft to reach all outer planets using gravitational assists . The mission was to send several pairs of probes and gained momentum in 1966 when it was endorsed by NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory . However, in December 1971, the Grand Tour mission was canceled when funding was redirected to the Space Shuttle program . [ 17 ] In 1972, a scaled-down (four planets, two identical spacecraft) mission was proposed, utilizing a spacecraft derived from the Mariner series, initially intended to be Mariner 11 and Mariner 12 . The gravity-assist technique, successfully demonstrated by Mariner 10 , would be used to achieve significant velocity changes by maneuvering through an intermediate planet's gravitational field to minimize time towards Saturn. [ 18 ] The spacecrafts were then moved into a separate program named Mariner Jupiter-Saturn (also Mariner Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus , [ 19 ] MJS , or MJSU ), part of the Mariner program , later renamed because it was thought that the design of the two space probes had progressed sufficiently beyond that of the Mariner family to merit a separate name. [ 20 ] Voyager probes [ edit ] Interactive 3D model of the Voyager spacecraft . On March 4, 1977, NASA announced a competition to rename the mission, believing the existing name was not appropriate as the mission had differed significantly from previous Mariner missions. Voyager was chosen as the new name, referencing an earlier suggestion by William Pickering , who had proposed the name Navigator . Due to the name change occurring close to launch, the probes were still occasionally referred to as Mariner 11 and Mariner 12, or even Voyager 11 and Voyager 12. [ 17 ] Two mission trajectories were established: JST aimed at Jupiter, Saturn, and enhancing a Titan flyby, while JSX served as a contingency plan. JST focused on a Titan flyby, while JSX provided a flexible mission plan. If JST succeeded, JSX could proceed with the Grand Tour, but in case of failure, JSX could be redirected for a separate Titan flyby, forfeiting the Grand Tour opportunity. [ 18 ] The second probe, now Voyager 2 , followed the JSX trajectory, granting it the option to continue on to Uranus and Neptune. Upon Voyager 1 completing its main objectives at Saturn, Voyager 2 received a mission extension, enabling it to proceed to Uranus and Neptune. This allowed Voyager 2 to diverge from the originally planned JST trajectory. [ 17 ] The probes would be launched in August or September 1977, with their main objective being to compare the characteristics of Jupiter and Saturn, such as their atmospheres , magnetic fields , particle environments, ring systems , and moons . They would fly by planets and moons in either a JST or JSX trajectory. After completing their flybys, the probes would communicate with Earth, relaying vital data using their magnetometers , spectrometers , and other instruments to detect interstellar , solar , and cosmic radiation . Their radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) would limit the maximum communication time with the probes to roughly a decade . Following their primary missions, the probes would continue to drift into interstellar space. [ 18 ] Voyager 2 was the first to be launched. Its trajectory was designed to allow flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Voyager 1 was launched after Voyager 2 , but along a shorter and faster trajectory that was designed to provide an optimal flyby of Saturn's moon Titan , [ 21 ] which was known to be quite large and to possess a dense atmosphere. This encounter sent Voyager 1 out of the plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission. [ 22 ] Had Voyager 1 been unable to perform the Titan flyby, the trajectory of Voyager 2 could have been altered to explore Titan, forgoing any visit to Uranus and Neptune. [ 23 ] Voyager 1 was not launched on a trajectory that would have allowed it to continue to Uranus and Neptune, but could have continued from Saturn to Pluto without exploring Titan. [ 24 ] During the 1990s, Voyager 1 overtook the slower deep-space probes Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 to become the most distant human-made object from Earth, a record that it will keep for the foreseeable future. The New Horizons probe, which had a higher launch velocity than Voyager 1 , is travelling more slowly due to the extra speed Voyager 1 gained from its flybys of Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 1 and Pioneer 10 are the most widely separated human-made objects anywhere since they are travelling in roughly opposite directions from the Solar System . In December 2004, Voyager 1 crossed the termination shock , where the solar wind is slowed to subsonic speed, and entered the heliosheath , where the solar wind is compressed and made turbulent due to interactions with the interstellar medium . On 10 December 2007, Voyager 2 also reached the termination shock, about 1.6 billion kilometres (1 billion miles) closer to the Sun than from where Voyager 1 first crossed it, indicating that the Solar System is asymmetrical . [ 25 ] In 2010 Voyager 1 reported that the outward velocity of the solar wind had dropped to zero, and scientists predicted it was nearing interstellar space . [ 26 ] In 2011, data from the Voyagers determined that the heliosheath was not smooth, but filled with giant magnetic bubbles. It was theorized that they formed when the magnetic field of the Sun became warped at the edge of the Solar System. [ 27 ] In June 2012, scientists at NASA reported that Voyager 1 was very close to entering interstellar space, which was indicated by a sharp rise in high-energy particles from outside the Solar System. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] In September 2013, NASA announced that Voyager 1 had crossed the heliopause on 25 August 2012, making it the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In December 2018, NASA announced that Voyager 2 had crossed the heliopause on 5 November 2018, making it the second spacecraft to enter interstellar space. [ 3 ] As of 2017 [update] Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 continued to monitor conditions in the outer expanses of the Solar System. [ 33 ] The Voyager spacecraft were expected to be able to operate science instruments through 2020, when limited power would require instruments to be deactivated one by one. It was expected that circa 2025 there would no longer be sufficient power to operate any scientific instruments. In July 2019, a revised power management plan was implemented for the two probes' dwindling power supplies. [ 34 ] Spacecraft design [ edit ] Voyager spacecraft diagram The Voyager spacecraft each weighed 815 kilograms (1,797 pounds) at launch, but after fuel usage are now about 733 kilograms (1,616 pounds). [ 35 ] Of this weight, each spacecraft carries 105 kilograms (231 pounds) of scientific instruments. [ 36 ] The identical Voyager spacecraft use three-axis-stabilized guidance systems that use gyroscopic and accelerometer inputs to their attitude control computers to point their high-gain antennas towards the Earth and their scientific instruments towards their targets, sometimes with the help of a movable instrument platform for the smaller instruments and the electronic photography system. The diagram shows the high-gain antenna (HGA) with a 3.7 m (12 ft) diameter dish attached to the hollow decagonal electronics container. There is also a spherical tank that contains the hydrazine monopropellant fuel. The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides. The angled square panel to the right is the optical calibration target and excess heat radiator. The three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) are mounted end-to-end on the lower boom. The scan platform comprises: the Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) (largest camera at top right); the Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS) just above the IRIS; the two Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) vidicon cameras to the left of the UVS; and the Photopolarimeter System (PPS) under the ISS. Only five investigation teams are still supported, though data is collected for two additional instruments. [ 37 ] The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) and a single eight-track digital tape recorder (DTR) provide the data handling functions. The FDS configures each instrument and controls instrument operations. It also collects engineering and science data and formats the data for transmission . The DTR is used to record high-rate Plasma Wave Subsystem (PWS) data, which is played back every six months. The Imaging Science Subsystem made up of a wide-angle and a narrow-angle camera is a modified version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used in the earlier Mariner flights. The Imaging Science Subsystem consists of two television-type cameras, each with eight filters in a commandable filter wheel mounted in front of the vidicons. One has a low resolution 200 mm (7.9 in) focal length wide-angle lens with an aperture of f/3 (the wide-angle camera), while the other uses a higher resolution 1,500 mm (59 in) narrow-angle f/8.5 lens (the narrow-angle camera). Three spacecraft were built, Voyager 1 (VGR 77-1), Voyager 2 (VGR 77-3), and test spare model (VGR 77-2).

Left: the cameras, ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers (far left), plasma detector (black box lower right), particle and radiation detectors (far right). On the boom, center and right, are plasma, particle, and cosmic ray detectors. Voyager's fully extended 13-meter-long magnetometer boom Computers and data processing [ edit ] There are three different computer types on the Voyager spacecraft, two of each kind, sometimes used for redundancy. They are proprietary, custom-built computers built from CMOS and TTL medium-scale CMOS integrated circuits and discrete components, mostly from the 7400 series of Texas Instruments . [ 41 ] The total number of words among the six computers is about 32K. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have identical computer systems. [ 35 ] [ 42 ] The Computer Command System (CCS), the central controller of the spacecraft, has two 18-bit word, interrupt-type processors with 4096 words each of non-volatile plated-wire memory . During most of the Voyager mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used non-redundantly to increase the command and processing capability of the spacecraft. The CCS is nearly identical to the system flown on the Viking spacecraft. [ 43 ] The Flight Data System (FDS) is two 16-bit word machines with modular memories and 8198 words each. The Attitude and Articulation Control System (AACS) is two 18-bit word machines with 4096 words each. Unlike the other on-board instruments, the operation of the cameras for visible light is not autonomous, but rather it is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained in one of the on-board digital computers , the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS). More recent space probes, since about 1990, usually have completely autonomous cameras. The computer command subsystem (CCS) controls the cameras. The CCS contains fixed computer programs such as command decoding, fault detection, and correction routines, antenna-pointing routines, and spacecraft sequencing routines. This computer is an improved version of the one that was used in the Viking orbiter . [ 43 ] The hardware in both custom-built CCS subsystems in the Voyagers is identical. There is only a minor software modification for one of them that has a scientific subsystem that the other lacks. According to Guinness Book of Records, CCS holds record of "longest period of continual operation for a computer". It has been running continuously since 20 August 1977. [ 44 ] The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) controls the spacecraft orientation (its attitude). It keeps the high-gain antenna pointing towards the Earth, controls attitude changes, and points the scan platform. The custom-built AACS systems on both craft are identical. It has been erroneously reported [ 45 ] on the Internet that the Voyager space probes were controlled by a version of the RCA 1802 (RCA CDP1802 "COSMAC" microprocessor ), but such claims are not supported by the primary design documents. The CDP1802 microprocessor was used later in the Galileo space probe , which was designed and built years later. The digital control electronics of the Voyagers were not based on a microprocessor integrated-circuit chip. Communications [ edit ] The uplink communications are executed via S-band microwave communications . The downlink communications are carried out by an X-band microwave transmitter on board the spacecraft, with an S-band transmitter as a back-up. All long-range communications to and from the two Voyagers have been carried out using their 3.7-meter (12 ft) high-gain antennas. The high-gain antenna has a beamwidth of 0.5° for X-band, and 2.3° for S-band. [ 46 ] : 17 (The low-gain antenna has a 7 dB gain and 60° beamwidth.) [ 46 ] : 17 Because of the inverse-square law in radio communications , the digital data rates used in the downlinks from the Voyagers have been continually decreasing the farther that they get from the Earth. For example, the data rate used from Jupiter was about 115,000 bits per second. That was halved at the distance of Saturn, and it has gone down continually since then. [ 46 ] Some measures were taken on the ground along the way to reduce the effects of the inverse-square law. In between 1982 and 1985, the diameters of the three main parabolic dish antennas of the Deep Space Network were increased from 64 to 70 m (210 to 230 ft) [ 46 ] : 34 dramatically increasing their areas for gathering weak microwave signals. Whilst the craft were between Saturn and Uranus the onboard software was upgraded to do a degree of image compression and to use a more efficient Reed-Solomon error-correcting encoding . [ 46 ] : 33 Then between 1986 and 1989, new techniques were brought into play to combine the signals from multiple antennas on the ground into one, more powerful signal, in a kind of an antenna array . [ 46 ] : 34 This was done at Goldstone, California , Canberra (Australia) , and Madrid (Spain) using the additional dish antennas available there. Also, in Australia, the Parkes Radio Telescope was brought into the array in time for the fly-by of Neptune in 1989. In the United States, the Very Large Array in New Mexico was brought into temporary use along with the antennas of the Deep Space Network at Goldstone. [ 46 ] : 34 Using this new technology of antenna arrays helped to compensate for the immense radio distance from Neptune to the Earth. Power [ edit ] RTGs for the Voyager program Electrical power is supplied by three MHW-RTG radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). They are powered by plutonium-238 (distinct from the Pu-239 isotope used in nuclear weapons) and provided approximately 470 W at 30 volts DC when the spacecraft was launched. Plutonium-238 decays with a half-life of 87.74 years, [ 47 ] so RTGs using Pu-238 will lose a factor of 1−0.5 (1/87.74) = 0.79% of their power output per year. In 2011, 34 years after launch, the thermal power generated by such an RTG would be reduced to (1/2) (34/87.74) ≈ 76% of its initial power. The RTG thermocouples , which convert thermal power into electricity, also degrade over time reducing available electric power below this calculated level. By 7 October 2011 the power generated by Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 had dropped to 267.9 W and 269.2 W respectively, about 57% of the power at launch. The level of power output was better than pre-launch predictions based on a conservative thermocouple degradation model. As the electrical power decreases, spacecraft loads must be turned off, eliminating some capabilities. There may be insufficient power for communications by 2032. [ 48 ] Voyager Interstellar Mission [ edit ] Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause, or the edge of the heliosphere , in August 2012. Voyager 2 crossed the heliosheath in November 2018. [ 3 ] [ 49 ] The Voyager primary mission was completed in 1989, with the close flyby of Neptune by Voyager 2 . The Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) is a mission extension, which began when the two spacecraft had already been in flight for over 12 years. [ 50 ] The Heliophysics Division of the NASA Science Mission Directorate conducted a Heliophysics Senior Review in 2008. The panel found that the VIM "is a mission that is absolutely imperative to continue" and that VIM "funding near the optimal level and increased DSN ( Deep Space Network ) support is warranted." [ 51 ] The main objective of the VIM was to extend the exploration of the Solar System beyond the outer planets to the heliopause (the farthest extent at which the Sun's radiation predominates over interstellar winds) and if possible even beyond. Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause boundary in 2012, followed by Voyager 2 in 2018. Passing through the heliopause boundary has allowed both spacecraft to make measurements of the interstellar fields, particles and waves unaffected by the solar wind . Two significant findings so far have been the discovery of a region of magnetic bubbles [ 52 ] and no indication of an expected shift in the Solar magnetic field. [ 53 ] The entire Voyager 2 scan platform, including all of the platform instruments, was switched off in 1998. All platform instruments on Voyager 1 , except for the ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS) [ 54 ] have also been switched off. The Voyager 1 scan platform was scheduled to go off-line in late 2000 but has been left on to investigate UV emission from the upwind direction.
UVS data are still captured but scans are no longer possible. [ 55 ] Gyro operations ended in 2016 for Voyager 2 and in 2017 for Voyager 1 . Gyro operations are used to rotate the probe 360 degrees six times per year to measure the magnetic field of the spacecraft, which is then subtracted from the magnetometer science data. On 14 November 2023, Voyager 1 stopped sending all telemetry and data, though the signal was still present.  After months of experiments, made considerably more difficult by the 45 hour round trip time, the cause was traced to a bad memory chip.  New software was written to avoid the bad memory block, and engineering data resumed on 20 April 2024. [ 56 ] Science data from two instruments resumed in May 2024, [ 57 ] and full recovery (of all science instruments that were still powered up) was in June 2024. [ 58 ] For more details of this intricate operation, see Voyager 1 . The two spacecraft continue to operate, with some loss in subsystem redundancy but retain the capability to return scientific data from a full complement of Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) science instruments. Both spacecraft also have adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to continue operating and collecting science data through at least 2026. [ 59 ] Though additional science instruments may need to be turned off, the spacecraft are expected to be able to communicate until 2036, in the absence of additional failures. [ 60 ] Mission details [ edit ] This diagram about the heliosphere was released on 28 June 2013 and incorporates results from the Voyager spacecraft. [ 61 ] By the start of VIM, Voyager 1 was at a distance of 40 AU from the Earth, while Voyager 2 was at 31 AU. VIM is in three phases: termination shock, heliosheath exploration, and interstellar exploration phase. The spacecraft began VIM in an environment controlled by the Sun's magnetic field, with the plasma particles being dominated by those contained in the expanding supersonic solar wind. This is the characteristic environment of the termination shock phase. At some distance from the Sun, the supersonic solar wind will be held back from further expansion by the interstellar wind. The first feature encountered by a spacecraft as a result of this interaction – between interstellar wind and solar wind – was the termination shock, where the solar wind slows to subsonic speed, and large changes in plasma flow direction and magnetic field orientation occur. Voyager 1 completed the phase of termination shock in December 2004 at a distance of 94 AU, while Voyager 2 completed it in August 2007 at a distance of 84 AU. After entering into the heliosheath, the spacecraft were in an area that is dominated by the Sun's magnetic field and solar wind particles. After passing through the heliosheath, the two Voyagers began the phase of interstellar exploration. The outer boundary of the heliosheath is called the heliopause. This is the region where the Sun's influence begins to decrease and interstellar space can be detected. [ 62 ] Voyager 1 is escaping the Solar System at the speed of 3.6 AU per year 35° north of the ecliptic in the general direction of the solar apex in Hercules , while Voyager 2 ' s speed is about 3.3 AU per year, heading 48° south of the ecliptic. The Voyager spacecraft will eventually go on to the stars. In about 40,000 years , Voyager 1 will be within 1.6 light years (ly) of AC+79 3888, also known as Gliese 445 , which is approaching the Sun. In 40,000 years Voyager 2 will be within 1.7 ly of Ross 248 (another star which is approaching the Sun), and in 296,000 years it will pass within 4.6 ly of Sirius , which is the brightest star in the night-sky. [ 2 ] The spacecraft are not expected to collide with a star for 1 sextillion (10 20 ) years. [ 63 ] In October 2020, astronomers reported a significant unexpected increase in density in the space beyond the Solar System , as detected by the Voyager space probes . According to the researchers, this implies that "the density gradient is a large-scale feature of the VLISM (very local interstellar medium ) in the general direction of the heliospheric nose ". [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Voyager Golden Record [ edit ] Main article: Voyager Golden Record The cover of the Voyager Golden Record Both spacecraft carry a 12-inch (30 cm) golden phonograph record that contains pictures and sounds of Earth, symbolic directions on the cover for playing the record, and data detailing the location of Earth. [ 33 ] [ 29 ] The record is intended as a combination time capsule and an interstellar message to any civilization, alien or far-future human, that may recover either of the Voyagers. The contents of this record were selected by a committee that included Timothy Ferris and was chaired by Carl Sagan . [ 29 ] Pale Blue Dot [ edit ] Main article: Pale Blue Dot Seen from 6 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles), Earth appears as a " pale blue dot " (the blueish-white speck approximately halfway down the light band to the right). Pale Blue Dot is a photograph of Earth taken on February 14, 1990, by the Voyager 1 space probe from a distance of approximately 6 billion kilometers ( 3.7 billion miles, 40.5 AU ), as part of that day's Family Portrait series of images of the Solar System . [ 66 ] The Voyager program's discoveries during the primary phase of its mission, including new close-up color photos of the major planets, were regularly documented by print and electronic media outlets. Among the best-known of these is an image of the Earth as a Pale Blue Dot , taken in 1990 by Voyager 1 , and popularized by Carl Sagan, [ 67 ] Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us....The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.... To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Named after astronomer Johannes Kepler , [ 8 ] the spacecraft was launched into an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit . The principal investigator was William J. Borucki . After nine and a half years of operation, the telescope's reaction control system fuel was depleted, and NASA announced its retirement on October 30, 2018. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Designed to survey a portion of Earth's region of the Milky Way to discover Earth-size exoplanets in or near habitable zones and to estimate how many of the billions of stars in the Milky Way have such planets, [ 6 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Kepler's sole scientific instrument is a photometer that continually monitored the brightness of approximately 150,000 main sequence stars in a fixed field of view. [ 13 ] These data were transmitted to Earth, then analyzed to detect periodic dimming caused by exoplanets that cross in front of their host star. Only planets whose orbits are seen edge-on from Earth could be detected. Kepler observed 530,506 stars, and had detected 2,778 confirmed planets as of June 16, 2023. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] History [ edit ] Pre-launch development [ edit ] The Kepler space telescope was part of NASA's Discovery Program of relatively low-cost science missions. The telescope's construction and initial operation were managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , with Ball Aerospace responsible for developing the Kepler flight system. [ 16 ] In January 2006, the project's launch was delayed eight months because of budget cuts and consolidation at NASA. [ 17 ] It was delayed again by four months in March 2006 due to fiscal problems. [ 17 ] During this time, the high-gain antenna was changed from a design using a gimbal to one fixed to the frame of the spacecraft to reduce cost and complexity, at the cost of one observation day per month. [ 18 ] Post launch [ edit ] The Ames Research Center was responsible for the ground system development, mission operations since December 2009, and scientific data analysis. The initial planned lifetime was three and a half years, [ 19 ] but greater-than-expected noise in the data , from both the stars and the spacecraft, meant additional time was needed to fulfill all mission goals. Initially, in 2012, the mission was expected to be extended until 2016, [ 20 ] but on July 14, 2012, one of the four reaction wheels used for pointing the spacecraft stopped turning, and completing the mission would only be possible if the other three all remained reliable. [ 21 ] Then, on May 11, 2013, a second one failed, disabling the collection of science data [ 22 ] and threatening the continuation of the mission. [ 23 ] On August 15, 2013, NASA announced that they had given up trying to fix the two failed reaction wheels. This meant the current mission needed to be modified, but it did not necessarily mean the end of planet hunting. NASA had asked the space science community to propose alternative mission plans "potentially including an exoplanet search, using the remaining two good reaction wheels and thrusters". [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] On November 18, 2013, the K2 "Second Light" proposal was reported. This would include utilizing the disabled Kepler in a way that could detect habitable planets around smaller, dimmer red dwarfs . [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] On May 16, 2014, NASA announced the approval of the K2 extension. [ 32 ] By January 2015, Kepler and its follow-up observations had found 1,013 confirmed exoplanets in about 440 star systems , along with a further 3,199 unconfirmed planet candidates. [ B ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Four planets have been confirmed through Kepler's K2 mission. [ 35 ] In November 2013, astronomers estimated, based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion rocky Earth-size exoplanets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarfs within the Milky Way . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] It is estimated that 11 billion of these planets may be orbiting Sun-like stars. [ 39 ] The nearest such planet may be 3.7 parsecs (12 ly ) away, according to the scientists. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] On January 6, 2015, NASA announced the 1,000th confirmed exoplanet discovered by the Kepler space telescope. Four of the newly confirmed exoplanets were found to orbit within habitable zones of their related stars : three of the four, Kepler-438b , Kepler-442b and Kepler-452b , are almost Earth-size and likely rocky; the fourth, Kepler-440b , is a super-Earth . [ 40 ] On May 10, 2016, NASA verified 1,284 new exoplanets found by Kepler, the single largest finding of planets to date. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Kepler data have also helped scientists observe and understand supernovae ; measurements were collected every half-hour so the light curves were especially useful for studying these types of astronomical events. [ 44 ] On October 30, 2018, after the spacecraft ran out of fuel, NASA announced that the telescope would be retired. [ 45 ] The telescope was shut down the same day, bringing an end to its nine-year service. Kepler observed 530,506 stars and discovered 2,662 exoplanets over its lifetime. [ 15 ] A newer NASA mission, TESS , launched in 2018, is continuing the search for exoplanets. [ 46 ] Spacecraft design [ edit ] Kepler in Astrotech's Hazardous Processing Facility Interactive 3D model of Kepler The telescope has a mass of 1,039 kilograms (2,291 lb) and contains a Schmidt camera with a 0.95-meter (37.4 in) front corrector plate (lens) feeding a 1.4-meter (55 in) primary mirror —at the time of its launch this was the largest mirror on any telescope outside Earth orbit, [ 47 ] though the Herschel Space Observatory took this title a few months later. Its telescope has a 115 deg 2 (about 12-degree diameter) field of view (FoV), roughly equivalent to the size of one's fist held at arm's length. Of this, 105 deg 2 is of science quality, with less than 11% vignetting . The photometer has a soft focus to provide excellent photometry , rather than sharp images. The mission goal was a combined differential photometric precision (CDPP) of 20 ppm for a m (V)=12 Sun-like star for a 6.5-hour integration, though the observations fell short of this objective (see mission status ). Camera [ edit ] Kepler's image sensor array. The array is curved to account for Petzval field curvature . The focal plane of the spacecraft's camera is made out of forty-two 50 × 25 mm (2 × 1 in) CCDs at 2200×1024 pixels each, possessing a total resolution of 94.6 megapixels , [ 48 ] [ 49 ] which at the time made it the largest camera system launched into space. [ 19 ] The array was cooled by heat pipes connected to an external radiator. [ 1 ] The CCDs were read out every 6.5 seconds (to limit saturation) and co-added on board for 58.89 seconds for short cadence targets, and 1765.5 seconds (29.4 minutes) for long cadence targets. [ 50 ] Due to the larger bandwidth requirements for the former, these were limited in number to 512 compared to 170,000 for long cadence. However, even though at launch Kepler had the highest data rate of any NASA mission, [ citation needed ] the 29-minute sums of all 95 million pixels constituted more data than could be stored and sent back to Earth. Therefore, the science team pre-selected the relevant pixels associated with each star of interest, amounting to about 6 percent of the pixels (5.4 megapixels). The data from these pixels was then requantized, compressed and stored, along with other auxiliary data, in the on-board 16 gigabyte solid-state recorder. Data that was stored and downlinked includes science stars, p-mode stars , smear, black level, background and full field-of-view images. [ 1 ] [ 51 ] Primary mirror [ edit ] Comparison of primary mirror sizes for the Kepler telescope and other notable optical telescopes. The Kepler primary mirror is 1.4 meters (4.6 ft) in diameter. Manufactured by glass maker Corning using ultra-low expansion (ULE) glass , the mirror is specifically designed to have a mass only 14% that of a solid mirror of the same size. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] To produce a space telescope system with sufficient sensitivity to detect relatively small planets, as they pass in front of stars, a very high reflectance coating on the primary mirror was required. Using ion assisted evaporation , Surface Optics Corp. applied a protective nine-layer silver coating to enhance reflection and a dielectric interference coating to minimize the formation of color centers and atmospheric moisture absorption. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Photometric performance [ edit ] In terms of photometric performance, Kepler worked well, much better than any Earth-bound telescope, but short of design goals. The objective was a combined differential photometric precision (CDPP) of 20 parts per million (PPM) on a magnitude 12 star for a 6.5-hour integration. This estimate was developed allowing 10 ppm for stellar variability, roughly the value for the Sun. The obtained accuracy for this observation has a wide range, depending on the star and position on the focal plane, with a median of 29 ppm. Most of the additional noise appears to be due to a larger-than-expected variability in the stars themselves (19.5 ppm as opposed to the assumed 10.0 ppm), with the rest due to instrumental noise sources slightly larger than predicted. [ 56 ] [ 48 ] Because decrease in brightness from an Earth-size planet transiting a Sun-like star is so small, only 80 ppm, the increased noise means each individual transit is only a 2.7 σ event, instead of the intended 4 σ. This, in turn, means more transits must be observed to be sure of a detection. Scientific estimates indicated that a mission lasting 7 to 8 years, as opposed to the originally planned 3.5 years, would be needed to find all transiting Earth-sized planets. [ 57 ] On April 4, 2012, the Kepler mission was approved for extension through the fiscal year 2016, [ 20 ] [ 58 ] but this also depended on all remaining reaction wheels staying healthy, which turned out not to be the case (see Reaction wheel issues below). Orbit and orientation [ edit ] Kepler's search volume, in the context of the Milky Way The motion of Kepler relative to Earth, slowly drifting away from Earth in a similar orbit, looking like a spiral over time Kepler orbits the Sun , [ 59 ] [ 60 ] which avoids Earth occultations , stray light, and gravitational perturbations and torques inherent in an Earth orbit. NASA has characterized Kepler's orbit as "Earth-trailing". [ 61 ] With an orbital period of 372.5 days, Kepler is slowly falling farther behind Earth (about 16 million miles per annum ). As of May 1, 2018 [update] , the distance to Kepler from Earth was about 0.917 AU (137 million km). [ 3 ] This means that after about 26 years Kepler will reach the other side of the Sun and will get back to the neighborhood of the Earth after 51 years. Until 2013 the photometer pointed to a field in the northern constellations of Cygnus , Lyra and Draco , which is well out of the ecliptic plane, so that sunlight never enters the photometer as the spacecraft orbits. [ 1 ] This is also the direction of the Solar System's motion around the center of the galaxy. Thus, the stars which Kepler observed are roughly the same distance from the Galactic Center as the Solar System , and also close to the galactic plane . This fact is important if position in the galaxy is related to habitability, as suggested by the Rare Earth hypothesis . Orientation is three-axis stabilized by sensing rotations using fine-guidance sensors located on the instrument focal plane (instead of rate sensing gyroscopes, e.g. as used on Hubble ). [ 1 ] and using reaction wheels and hydrazine thrusters [ 62 ] to control the orientation. Animation of Kepler 's trajectory Relative to the Sun Relative to Earth Relative to Sun and Earth Kepler · Earth · Sun Operations [ edit ] Kepler's orbit. The telescope's solar array was adjusted at solstices and equinoxes . Kepler was operated out of Boulder, Colorado , by the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) under contract to Ball Aerospace & Technologies . The spacecraft's solar array was rotated to face the Sun at the solstices and equinoxes , so as to optimize the amount of sunlight falling on the solar array and to keep the heat radiator pointing towards deep space. [ 1 ] Together, LASP and Ball Aerospace controlled the spacecraft from a mission operations center located on the research campus of the University of Colorado . LASP performs essential mission planning and the initial collection and distribution of the science data. The mission's initial life-cycle cost was estimated at US$600 million, including funding for 3.5 years of operation. [ 1 ] In 2012, NASA announced that the Kepler mission would be funded until 2016 at a cost of about $20 million per year. [ 20 ] Communications [ edit ] NASA contacted the spacecraft using the X band communication link twice a week for command and status updates. Scientific data are downloaded once a month using the K a band link at a maximum data transfer rate of approximately 550 kB/s . The high gain antenna is not steerable so data collection is interrupted for a day to reorient the whole spacecraft and the high gain antenna for communications to  Earth. [ 1 ] : 16 Kepler was the first mission to rely on K a -band data downlink, and in turn collected statistics on K a -band performance for later missions using this technology. [ 63 ] The Kepler space telescope conducted its own partial analysis on board and only transmitted scientific data deemed necessary to the mission in order to conserve bandwidth. [ 64 ] Data management [ edit ] Science data telemetry collected during mission operations at LASP is sent for processing to the Kepler Data Management Center (DMC) which is located at the Space Telescope Science Institute on the campus of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland . The science data telemetry is decoded and processed into uncalibrated FITS -format science data products by the DMC, which are then passed along to the Science Operations Center (SOC) at NASA Ames Research Center, for calibration and final processing. The SOC at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) develops and operates the tools needed to process scientific data for use by the Kepler Science Office (SO). Accordingly, the SOC develops the pipeline data processing software based on scientific algorithms developed jointly by the SO and SOC. During operations, the SOC: [ 65 ] Receives uncalibrated pixel data from the DMC Applies the analysis algorithms to produce calibrated pixels and light curves for each star Performs transit searches for detection of planets (threshold-crossing events, or TCEs) Performs data validation of candidate planets by evaluating various data products for consistency as a way to eliminate false positive detections The SOC also evaluates the photometric performance on an ongoing basis and provides the performance metrics to the SO and Mission Management Office. Finally, the SOC develops and maintains the project's scientific databases, including catalogs and processed data. The SOC finally returns calibrated data products and scientific results back to the DMC for long-term archiving, and distribution to astronomers around the world through the Multimission Archive at STScI (MAST). Reaction wheel failures [ edit ] On July 14, 2012, one of the four reaction wheels used for fine pointing of the spacecraft failed. [ 66 ] While Kepler requires only three reaction wheels to accurately aim the telescope, another failure would leave the spacecraft unable to aim at its original field. [ 67 ] After showing some problems in January 2013, a second reaction wheel failed on May 11, 2013, ending Kepler's primary mission. The spacecraft was put into safe mode, then from June to August 2013 a series of engineering tests were done to try to recover either failed wheel. By August 15, 2013, it was decided that the wheels were unrecoverable, [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] and an engineering report was ordered to assess the spacecraft's remaining capabilities. [ 24 ] This effort ultimately led to the "K2" follow-on mission observing different fields near the ecliptic. The reaction wheel failures were traced back to pitting caused by arcing between the steel ball bearings in the reaction wheel.  The arcing was in turn caused by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the sun.  Kepler's position far from Earth helped in determining the cause,  due to the significant delay between the arrival of a CME at Kepler and Earth. [ 68 ] Operational timeline [ edit ] Kepler's launch on March 7, 2009 Interior illustration of Kepler A 2004 illustration of Kepler In January 2006, the project's launch was delayed eight months because of budget cuts and consolidation at NASA. [ 17 ] It was delayed again by four months in March 2006 due to fiscal problems. [ 17 ] At this time, the high-gain antenna was changed from a gimballed design to one fixed to the frame of the spacecraft to reduce cost and complexity, at the cost of one observation day per month. The Kepler observatory was launched on March 7, 2009, at 03:49:57 UTC aboard a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , Florida. [ 2 ] [ 5 ] The launch was a success and all three stages were completed by 04:55 UTC. The cover of the telescope was jettisoned on April 7, 2009, and the first light images were taken on the next day. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] On April 20, 2009, it was announced that the Kepler science team had concluded that further refinement of the focus would dramatically increase the scientific return. [ 71 ] On April 23, 2009, it was announced that the focus had been successfully optimized by moving the primary mirror 40 micrometers (1.6 thousandths of an inch) towards the focal plane and tilting the primary mirror 0.0072 degree. [ 72 ] On May 13, 2009, at 00:01 UTC, Kepler successfully completed its commissioning phase and began its search for planets around other stars. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] On June 19, 2009, the spacecraft successfully sent its first science data to Earth. It was discovered that Kepler had entered safe mode on June 15. A second safe mode event occurred on July 2. In both cases the event was triggered by a processor reset . The spacecraft resumed normal operation on July 3 and the science data that had been collected since June 19 was downlinked that day. [ 75 ] On October 14, 2009, the cause of these safing events was determined to be a low voltage power supply that provides power to the RAD750 processor. [ 76 ] On January 12, 2010, one portion of the focal plane transmitted anomalous data, suggesting a problem with focal plane MOD-3 module, covering two out of Kepler's 42 CCDs . As of October 2010 [update] , the module was described as "failed", but the coverage still exceeded the science goals. [ 77 ] Kepler downlinked roughly twelve gigabytes of data [ 78 ] about once per month. [ 79 ] Field of view [ edit ] Diagram of Kepler's investigated area with celestial coordinates Kepler has a fixed field of view (FOV) against the sky. The diagram to the right shows the celestial coordinates and where the detector fields are located, along with the locations of a few bright stars with celestial north at the top left corner. The mission website has a calculator [ 80 ] that will determine if a given object falls in the FOV, and if so, where it will appear in the photo detector output data stream. Data on exoplanet candidates is submitted to the Kepler Follow-up Program , or KFOP, to conduct follow-up observations. The photometer's field of view in the constellations Cygnus , Lyra and Draco Kepler's field of view covers 115 square degrees , around 0.25 percent of the sky, or "about two scoops of the Big Dipper". Thus, it would require around 400 Kepler-like telescopes to cover the whole sky. [ 81 ] The Kepler field contains portions of the constellations Cygnus , Lyra , and Draco . The nearest star system in Kepler's field of view is the triple star system Gliese 1245 , 15 light years from the Sun. The brown dwarf WISE J2000+3629, 22.8 ± 1 light years from the Sun is also in the field of view, but is invisible to Kepler due to emitting light primarily in infrared wavelengths. Objectives and methods [ edit ] The scientific objective of the Kepler space telescope was to explore the structure and diversity of planetary systems . [ 82 ] This spacecraft observes a large sample of stars to achieve several key goals: To determine how many Earth-size and larger planets there are in or near the habitable zone (often called "Goldilocks planets") [ 83 ] of a wide variety of spectral types of stars. To determine the range of size and shape of the orbits of these planets. To estimate how many planets there are in multiple-star systems. To determine the range of orbit size, brightness, size, mass and density of short-period giant planets. To identify additional members of each discovered planetary system using other techniques. Determine the properties of those stars that harbor planetary systems. Most of the exoplanets previously detected by other projects were giant planets , mostly the size of Jupiter and bigger. Kepler was designed to look for planets 30 to 600 times less massive, closer to the order of Earth's mass (Jupiter is 318 times more massive than Earth). The method used, the transit method , involves observing repeated transit of planets in front of their stars, which causes a slight reduction in the star's apparent magnitude , on the order of 0.01% for an Earth-size planet. The degree of this reduction in brightness can be used to deduce the diameter of the planet, and the interval between transits can be used to deduce the planet's orbital period, from which estimates of its orbital semi-major axis (using Kepler's laws ) and its temperature (using models of stellar radiation) can be calculated. [ citation needed ] The probability of a random planetary orbit being along the line-of-sight to a star is the diameter of the star divided by the diameter of the orbit. [ 84 ] For an Earth-size planet at 1 AU transiting a Sun-like star the probability is 0.47%, or about 1 in 210. [ 84 ] For a planet like Venus orbiting a Sun-like star the probability is slightly higher, at 0.65%; [ 84 ] If the host star has multiple planets, the probability of additional detections is higher than the probability of initial detection assuming planets in a given system tend to orbit in similar planes—an assumption consistent with current models of planetary system formation. [ 84 ] For instance, if a Kepler -like mission conducted by aliens observed Earth transiting the Sun, there is a 7% chance that it would also see Venus transiting. [ 84 ] Kepler's 115 deg 2 field of view gives it a much higher probability of detecting Earth-sized planets than the Hubble Space Telescope , which has a field of view of only 10 sq. arc-minutes . Moreover, Kepler is dedicated to detecting planetary transits, while the Hubble Space Telescope is used to address a wide range of scientific questions, and rarely looks continuously at just one starfield. Of the approximately half-million stars in Kepler's field of view, around 150,000 stars were selected for observation. More than 90,000 are G-type stars on, or near, the main sequence . Thus, Kepler was designed to be sensitive to wavelengths of 400–865 nm where brightness of those stars peaks. Most of the stars observed by Kepler have apparent visual magnitude between 14 and 16 but the brightest observed stars have apparent visual magnitude of 8 or lower. Most of the planet candidates were initially not expected to be confirmed due to being too faint for follow-up observations. [ 85 ] All the selected stars are observed simultaneously, with the spacecraft measuring variations in their brightness every thirty minutes. This provides a better chance for seeing a transit. The mission was designed to maximize the probability of detecting planets orbiting other stars. [ 1 ] [ 86 ] Because Kepler must observe at least three transits to confirm that the dimming of a star was caused by a transiting planet, and because larger planets give a signal that is easier to check, scientists expected the first reported results to be larger Jupiter-size planets in tight orbits. The first of these were reported after only a few months of operation. Smaller planets, and planets farther from their sun would take longer, and discovering planets comparable to Earth were expected to take three years or longer. [ 59 ] Data collected by Kepler is also being used for studying variable stars of various types and performing asteroseismology , [ 87 ] particularly on stars showing solar-like oscillations . [ 88 ] Planet finding process [ edit ] Finding planet candidates [ edit ] Artist's impression of Kepler Once Kepler has collected and sent back the data, raw light curves are constructed. Brightness values are then adjusted to take the brightness variations due to the rotation of the spacecraft into account. The next step is processing (folding) light curves into a more easily observable form and letting software select signals that seem potentially transit-like. At this point, any signal that shows potential transit-like features is called a threshold crossing event. These signals are individually inspected in two inspection rounds, with the first round taking only a few seconds per target. This inspection eliminates erroneously selected non-signals, signals caused by instrumental noise and obvious eclipsing binaries. [ 89 ] Threshold crossing events that pass these tests are called Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI), receive a KOI designation and are archived. KOIs are inspected more thoroughly in a process called dispositioning. Those which pass the dispositioning are called Kepler planet candidates. The KOI archive is not static, meaning that a Kepler candidate could end up in the false-positive list upon further inspection. In turn, KOIs that were mistakenly classified as false positives could end up back in the candidates list. [ 90 ] Not all the planet candidates go through this process. Circumbinary planets do not show strictly periodic transits, and have to be inspected through other methods. In addition, third-party researchers use different data-processing methods, or even search planet candidates from the unprocessed light curve data. As a consequence, those planets may be missing KOI designation. Confirming planet candidates [ edit ] Kepler mission – new exoplanet candidates – as of June 19, 2017. [ 91 ] Once suitable candidates have been found from Kepler data, it is necessary to rule out false positives with follow-up tests. Usually, Kepler candidates are imaged individually with more-advanced ground-based telescopes in order to resolve any background objects which could contaminate the brightness signature of the transit signal. [ 92 ] Another method to rule out planet candidates is astrometry for which Kepler can collect good data even though doing so was not a design goal. While Kepler cannot detect planetary-mass objects with this method, it can be used to determine if the transit was caused by a stellar-mass object. [ 93 ] Through other detection methods [ edit ] There are a few different exoplanet detection methods which help to rule out false positives by giving further proof that a candidate is a real planet. One of the methods, called doppler spectroscopy , requires follow-up observations from ground-based telescopes. This method works well if the planet is massive or is located around a relatively bright star. While current spectrographs are insufficient for confirming planetary candidates with small masses around relatively dim stars, this method can be used to discover additional massive non-transiting planet candidates around targeted stars. [ citation needed ] A photo taken by Kepler with two points of interest outlined. Celestial north is towards the lower left corner. In multiplanetary systems, planets can often be confirmed through transit timing variation by looking at the time between successive transits, which may vary if planets are gravitationally perturbed by each other. This helps to confirm relatively low-mass planets even when the star is relatively distant. Transit timing variations indicate that two or more planets belong to the same planetary system. There are even cases where a non-transiting planet is also discovered in this way. [ 94 ] Circumbinary planets show much larger transit timing variations between transits than planets gravitationally disturbed by other planets. Their transit duration times also vary significantly. Transit timing and duration variations for circumbinary planets are caused by the orbital motion of the host stars, rather than by other planets. [ 95 ] In addition, if the planet is massive enough, it can cause slight variations of the host stars' orbital periods. Despite being harder to find circumbinary planets due to their non-periodic transits, it is much easier to confirm them, as timing patterns of transits cannot be mimicked by an eclipsing binary or a background star system. [ 96 ] In addition to transits, planets orbiting around their stars undergo reflected-light variations—like the Moon , they go through phases from full to new and back again. Because Kepler cannot resolve the planet from the star, it sees only the combined light, and the brightness of the host star seems to change over each orbit in a periodic manner. Although the effect is small—the photometric precision required to see a close-in giant planet is about the same as to detect an Earth-sized planet in transit across a solar-type star—Jupiter-sized planets with an orbital period of a few days or less are detectable by sensitive space telescopes such as Kepler. In the long run, this method may help find more planets than the transit method, because the reflected light variation with orbital phase is largely independent of the planet's orbital inclination, and does not require the planet to pass in front of the disk of the star. In addition, the phase function of a giant planet is also a function of its thermal properties and atmosphere, if any. Therefore, the phase curve may constrain other planetary properties, such as the particle size distribution of the atmospheric particles. [ 97 ] Kepler's photometric precision is often high enough to observe a star's brightness changes caused by doppler beaming or a star's shape deformation by a companion. These can sometimes be used to rule out hot Jupiter candidates as false positives caused by a star or a brown dwarf when these effects are too noticeable. [ 98 ] However, there are some cases where such effects are detected even by planetary-mass companions such as TrES-2b . [ 99 ] Through validation [ edit ] If a planet cannot be detected through at least one of the other detection methods, it can be confirmed by determining if the possibility of a Kepler candidate being a real planet is significantly larger than any false-positive scenarios combined. One of the first methods was to see if other telescopes can see the transit as well. The first planet confirmed through this method was Kepler-22b which was also observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope in addition to analyzing any other false-positive possibilities. [ 100 ] Such confirmation is costly, as small planets can generally be detected only with space telescopes. In 2014, a new confirmation method called "validation by multiplicity" was announced. From the planets previously confirmed through various methods, it was found that planets in most planetary systems orbit in a relatively flat plane, similar to the planets found in the Solar System. This means that if a star has multiple planet candidates, it is very likely a real planetary system. [ 101 ] Transit signals still need to meet several criteria which rule out false-positive scenarios. For instance, it has to have considerable signal-to-noise ratio, it has at least three observed transits, orbital stability of those systems have to be stable and transit curve has to have a shape that partly eclipsing binaries could not mimic the transit signal. In addition, its orbital period needs to be 1.6 days or longer to rule out common false positives caused by eclipsing binaries. [ 102 ] Validation by multiplicity method is very efficient and allows to confirm hundreds of Kepler candidates in a relatively short amount of time. A new validation method using a tool called PASTIS has been developed. It makes it possible to confirm a planet even when only a single candidate transit event for the host star has been detected. A drawback of this tool is that it requires a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio from Kepler data, so it can mainly confirm only larger planets or planets around quiet and relatively bright stars. Currently, the analysis of Kepler candidates through this method is underway. [ 103 ] PASTIS was first successful for validating the planet Kepler-420b. [ 104 ] K2 Extension [ edit ] Predicted structure of the Milky Way overlaid with the original Kepler search space. [ 6 ] In April 2012, an independent panel of senior NASA scientists recommended that the Kepler mission be continued through 2016. According to the senior review, Kepler observations needed to continue until at least 2015 to achieve all the stated scientific goals. [ 105 ] On November 14, 2012, NASA announced the completion of Kepler's primary mission, and the beginning of its extended mission, which ended in 2018 when it ran out of fuel. [ 106 ] Reaction wheel issues [ edit ] In July 2012, one of Kepler's four reaction wheels (wheel 2) failed. [ 24 ] On May 11, 2013, a second wheel (wheel 4) failed, jeopardizing the continuation of the mission, as three wheels are necessary for its planet hunting. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Kepler had not collected science data since May because it was not able to point with sufficient accuracy. [ 107 ] On July 18 and 22 reaction wheels 4 and 2 were tested respectively; wheel 4 only rotated counter-clockwise but wheel 2 ran in both directions, albeit with significantly elevated friction levels. [ 108 ] A further test of wheel 4 on July 25 managed to achieve bi-directional rotation. [ 109 ] Both wheels, however, exhibited too much friction to be useful. [ 26 ] On August 2, NASA put out a call for proposals to use the remaining capabilities of Kepler for other scientific missions. Starting on August 8, a full systems evaluation was conducted. It was determined that wheel 2 could not provide sufficient precision for scientific missions and the spacecraft was returned to a "rest" state to conserve fuel. [ 24 ] Wheel 4 was previously ruled out because it exhibited higher friction levels than wheel 2 in previous tests. [ 109 ] Sending astronauts to fix Kepler is not an option because it orbits the Sun and is millions of kilometers from Earth. [ 26 ] On August 15, 2013, NASA announced that Kepler would not continue searching for planets using the transit method after attempts to resolve issues with two of the four reaction wheels failed. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] An engineering report was ordered to assess the spacecraft's capabilities, its two good reaction wheels and its thrusters. [ 24 ] Concurrently, a scientific study was conducted to determine whether enough knowledge can be obtained from Kepler's limited scope to justify its $18 million per year cost. Possible ideas included searching for asteroids and comets, looking for evidence of supernovas, and finding huge exoplanets through gravitational microlensing . [ 26 ] Another proposal was to modify the software on Kepler to compensate for the disabled reaction wheels. Instead of the stars being fixed and stable in Kepler's field of view, they will drift. Proposed software was to track this drift and more or less completely recover the mission goals despite being unable to hold the stars in a fixed view. [ 110 ] Previously collected data continued to be analyzed. [ 111 ] Second Light (K2) [ edit ] In November 2013, a new mission plan named K2 "Second Light" was presented for consideration. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 112 ] K2 would involve using Kepler's remaining capability, photometric precision of about 300 parts per million, compared with about 20 parts per million earlier, to collect data for the study of " supernova explosions , star formation and Solar-System bodies such as asteroids and comets , ... " and for finding and studying more exoplanets . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 112 ] In this proposed mission plan, Kepler would search a much larger area in the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 112 ] Celestial objects, including exoplanets, stars and others, detected by the K2 mission would be associated with the EPIC acronym , standing for Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog . K2 mission timeline (August 8, 2014). [ 113 ] In early 2014, the spacecraft underwent successful testing for the K2 mission. [ 114 ] From March to May 2014, data from a new field called Field 0 was collected as a testing run. [ 115 ] On May 16, 2014, NASA announced the approval of extending the Kepler mission to the K2 mission. [ 32 ] Kepler's photometric precision for the K2 mission was estimated to be 50 ppm on a magnitude 12 star for a 6.5-hour integration. [ 116 ] In February 2014, photometric precision for the K2 mission using two-wheel, fine-point precision operations was measured as 44 ppm on magnitude 12 stars for a 6.5-hour integration. The analysis of these measurements by NASA suggests the K2 photometric precision approaches that of the Kepler archive of three-wheel, fine-point precision data. [ 117 ] On May 29, 2014, campaign fields 0 to 13 were reported and described in detail. [ 118 ] K2 proposal explained (December 11, 2013). [ 30 ] Field 1 of the K2 mission is set towards the Leo - Virgo region of the sky, while Field 2 is towards the "head" area of Scorpius and includes two globular clusters, Messier 4 and Messier 80 , [ 119 ] and part of the Scorpius–Centaurus association , which is only about 11 million years old [ 120 ] and 120–140 parsecs (380–470 ly ) distant [ 121 ] with probably over 1,000 members. [ 122 ] On December 18, 2014, NASA announced that the K2 mission had detected its first confirmed exoplanet, a super-Earth named HIP 116454 b . Its signature was found in a set of engineering data meant to prepare the spacecraft for the full K2 mission. Radial velocity follow-up observations were needed as only a single transit of the planet was detected. [ 123 ] During a scheduled contact on April 7, 2016, Kepler was found to be operating in emergency mode, the lowest operational and most fuel intensive mode. Mission operations declared a spacecraft emergency, which afforded them priority access to NASA's Deep Space Network . [ 124 ] [ 125 ] By the evening of April 8 the spacecraft had been upgraded to safe mode, and on April 10 it was placed into point-rest state, [ 126 ] a stable mode which provides normal communication and the lowest fuel burn. [ 124 ] At that time, the cause of the emergency was unknown, but it was not believed that Kepler's reaction wheels or a planned maneuver to support K2 's Campaign 9 were responsible. Operators downloaded and analyzed engineering data from the spacecraft, with the prioritization of returning to normal science operations. [ 124 ] [ 127 ] Kepler was returned to science mode on April 22. [ 128 ] The emergency caused the first half of Campaign 9 to be shortened by two weeks. [ 129 ] In June 2016, NASA announced a K2 mission extension of three additional years, beyond the expected exhaustion of on-board fuel in 2018. [ 130 ] In August 2018, NASA roused the spacecraft from sleep mode, applied a modified configuration to deal with thruster problems that degraded pointing performance, and began collecting scientific data for the 19th observation campaign, finding that the onboard fuel was not yet utterly exhausted. [ 131 ] On October 30, 2018, NASA announced that the spacecraft was out of fuel and its mission was officially ended. [ 132 ] Mission results [ edit ] Detail of Kepler 's image of the investigated area showing open star cluster NGC 6791 . Celestial north is towards the lower left corner. Detail of Kepler 's image of the investigated area. The location of TrES-2b within this image is shown. Celestial north is towards the lower left corner. The Kepler space telescope was in active operation from 2009 through 2013, with the first main results announced on January 4, 2010. As expected, the initial discoveries were all short-period planets. As the mission continued, additional longer-period candidates were found. As of November 2018 [update] , Kepler has discovered 5,011 exoplanet candidates and 2,662 confirmed exoplanets. [ 133 ] [ 134 ] As of August 2022, 2,056 exoplanet candidates remain to be confirmed and 2,711 are now confirmed exoplanets. [ 135 ] 2009 [ edit ] NASA held a press conference to discuss early science results of the Kepler mission on August 6, 2009. [ 136 ] At this press conference, it was revealed that Kepler had confirmed the existence of the previously known transiting exoplanet HAT-P-7b , and was functioning well enough to discover Earth-size planets. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] Because Kepler's detection of planets depends on seeing very small changes in brightness, stars that vary in brightness by themselves ( variable stars ) are not useful in this search. [ 79 ] From the first few months of data, Kepler scientists determined that about 7,500 stars from the initial target list are such variable stars. These were dropped from the target list, and replaced by new candidates. On November 4, 2009, the Kepler project publicly released the light curves of the dropped stars. [ 139 ] The first new planet candidate observed by Kepler was originally marked as a false positive because of uncertainties in the mass of its parent star. However, it was confirmed ten years later and is now designated Kepler-1658b . [ 140 ] [ 141 ] The first six weeks of data revealed five previously unknown planets, all very close to their stars. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] Among the notable results are one of the least dense planets yet found, [ 144 ] two low-mass white dwarfs [ 145 ] that were initially reported as being members of a new class of stellar objects, [ 146 ] and Kepler-16b , a well-characterized planet orbiting a binary star. 2010 [ edit ] On June 15, 2010, the Kepler mission released data on all but 400 of the ~156,000 planetary target stars to the public. 706 targets from this first data set have viable exoplanet candidates, with sizes ranging from as small as Earth to larger than Jupiter. The identity and characteristics of 306 of the 706 targets were given. The released targets included five [ citation needed ] candidate multi-planet systems, including six extra exoplanet candidates. [ 147 ] Only 33.5 days of data were available for most of the candidates. [ 147 ] NASA also announced data for another 400 candidates were being withheld to allow members of the Kepler team to perform follow-up observations. [ 148 ] The data for these candidates was published February 2, 2011. [ 149 ] (See the Kepler results for 2011 below.) The Kepler results, based on the candidates in the list released in 2010, implied that most candidate planets have radii less than half that of Jupiter. The  results also imply that small candidate planets with periods less than thirty days are much more common than large candidate planets with periods less than thirty days and that the ground-based discoveries are sampling the large-size tail of the size distribution. [ 147 ] This contradicted older theories which had suggested small and Earth-size planets would be relatively infrequent. [ 150 ] [ 151 ] Based on extrapolations from the Kepler data, an estimate of around 100 million habitable planets in the Milky Way may be realistic. [ 152 ] Some media reports of the TED talk have led to the misunderstanding that Kepler had actually found these planets. This was clarified in a letter to the Director of the NASA Ames Research Center , for the Kepler Science Council dated August 2, 2010 states, "Analysis of the current Kepler data does not support the assertion that Kepler has found any Earth-like planets." [ 7 ] [ 153 ] [ 154 ] In 2010, Kepler identified two systems containing objects which are smaller and hotter than their parent stars: KOI 74 and KOI 81 . [ 155 ] These objects are probably low-mass white dwarfs produced by previous episodes of mass transfer in their systems. [ 145 ] 2011 [ edit ] A size comparison of the exoplanets Kepler-20e [ 156 ] and Kepler-20f [ 157 ] with Venus and Earth On February 2, 2011, the Kepler team announced the results of analysis of the data taken between 2 May and September 16, 2009. [ 149 ] They found 1235 planetary candidates circling 997 host stars. (The numbers that follow assume the candidates are really planets, though the official papers called them only candidates. Independent analysis indicated that at least 90% of them are real planets and not false positives). [ 158 ] 68 planets were approximately Earth-size, 288 super-Earth -size, 662 Neptune-size, 165 Jupiter-size, and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter. In contrast to previous work, roughly 74% of the planets are smaller than Neptune, most likely as a result of previous work finding large planets more easily than smaller ones. That February 2, 2011 release of 1235 exoplanet candidates included 54 that may be in the " habitable zone ", including five less than twice the size of Earth. [ 159 ] [ 160 ] There were previously only two planets thought to be in the "habitable zone", so these new findings represent an enormous expansion of the potential number of "Goldilocks planets" (planets of the right temperature to support liquid water). [ 161 ] All of the habitable zone candidates found thus far orbit stars significantly smaller and cooler than the Sun (habitable candidates around Sun-like stars will take several additional years to accumulate the three transits required for detection). [ 162 ] Of all the new planet candidates, 68 are 125% of Earth 's size or smaller, or smaller than all previously discovered exoplanets. [ 160 ] "Earth-size" and "super-Earth-size" is defined as "less than or equal to 2 Earth radii (Re)" [(or, Rp ≤ 2.0 Re) – Table 5]. [ 149 ] Six such planet candidates [namely: KOI 326.01 (Rp=0.85), KOI 701.03 (Rp=1.73), KOI 268.01 (Rp=1.75), KOI 1026.01 (Rp=1.77), KOI 854.01 (Rp=1.91), KOI 70.03 (Rp=1.96) – Table 6] [ 149 ] are in the "habitable zone." [ 159 ] A more recent study found that one of these candidates (KOI 326.01) is in fact much larger and hotter than first reported. [ 163 ] The frequency of planet observations was highest for exoplanets two to three times Earth-size, and then declined in inverse proportionality to the area of the planet. The best estimate (as of March 2011), after accounting for observational biases, was: 5.4% of stars host Earth-size candidates, 6.8% host super-Earth-size candidates, 19.3% host Neptune-size candidates, and 2.55% host Jupiter-size or larger candidates. Multi-planet systems are common; 17% of the host stars have multi-candidate systems, and 33.9% of all the planets are in multiple planet systems. [ 164 ] By December 5, 2011, the Kepler team announced that they had discovered 2,326 planetary candidates, of which 207 are similar in size to Earth, 680 are super-Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune-size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. Compared to the February 2011 figures, the number of Earth-size and super-Earth-size planets increased by 200% and 140% respectively. Moreover, 48 planet candidates were found in the habitable zones of surveyed stars, marking a decrease from the February figure; this was due to the more stringent criteria in use in the December data. [ 165 ] On December 20, 2011, the Kepler team announced the discovery of the first Earth-size exoplanets , Kepler-20e [ 156 ] and Kepler-20f , [ 157 ] orbiting a Sun-like star , Kepler-20 . [ 166 ] Based on Kepler's findings, astronomer Seth Shostak estimated in 2011 that "within a thousand light-years of Earth", there are "at least 30,000" habitable planets. [ 167 ] Also based on the findings, the Kepler team has estimated that there are "at least 50 billion planets in the Milky Way", of which "at least 500 million" are in the habitable zone . [ 168 ] In March 2011, astronomers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) reported that about "1.4 to 2.7 percent" of all Sun-like stars are expected to have Earth-size planets "within the habitable zones of their stars". This means there are "two billion" of these "Earth analogs" in the Milky Way alone. The JPL astronomers also noted that there are "50 billion other galaxies", potentially yielding more than one sextillion "Earth analog" planets if all galaxies have similar numbers of planets to the Milky Way. [ 169 ] 2012 [ edit ] In January 2012, an international team of astronomers reported that each star in the Milky Way may host " on average...at least 1.6 planets ", suggesting that over 160 billion star-bound planets may exist in the Milky Way. [ 170 ] [ 171 ] Kepler also recorded distant stellar super-flares , some of which are 10,000 times more powerful than the 1859 Carrington Event . [ 172 ] The superflares may be triggered by close-orbiting Jupiter -sized planets. [ 172 ] The Transit Timing Variation (TTV) technique, which was used to discover Kepler-9d , gained popularity for confirming exoplanet discoveries. [ 173 ] A planet in a system with four stars was also confirmed, the first time such a system had been discovered. [ 174 ] As of 2012 [update] , there were a total of 2,321 candidates . [ 165 ] [ 175 ] [ 176 ] Of these, 207 are similar in size to Earth, 680 are super-Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune-size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. Moreover, 48 planet candidates were found in the habitable zones of surveyed stars. The Kepler team estimated that 5.4% of all stars host Earth-size planet candidates, and that 17% of all stars have multiple planets. 2013 [ edit ] A chart showing Kepler discoveries, in context of all discovered exoplanets (through 2013), with some transit probabilities indicated for example scenarios. According to a study by Caltech astronomers published in January 2013, the Milky Way contains at least as many planets as it does stars, resulting in 100–400 billion exoplanets . [ 177 ] [ 178 ] The study, based on planets orbiting the star Kepler-32 , suggests that planetary systems may be common around stars in the Milky Way. The discovery of 461 more candidates was announced on January 7, 2013. [ 107 ] The longer Kepler watches, the more planets with long periods it can detect. [ 107 ] Since the last Kepler catalog was released in February 2012, the number of candidates discovered in the Kepler data has increased by 20 percent and now totals 2,740 potential planets orbiting 2,036 stars A candidate, newly announced on January 7, 2013, was Kepler-69c (formerly, KOI-172.02 ), an Earth-size exoplanet orbiting a star similar to the Sun in the habitable zone and possibly habitable. [ 179 ] In April 2013, a white dwarf was discovered bending the light of its companion red dwarf in the KOI-256 star system. [ 180 ] In April 2013, NASA announced the discovery of three new Earth-size exoplanets— Kepler-62e , Kepler-62f , and Kepler-69c —in the habitable zones of their respective host stars, Kepler-62 and Kepler-69 . The new exoplanets are considered prime candidates for possessing liquid water and thus a habitable environment. [ 181 ] [ 182 ] [ 183 ] A more recent analysis has shown that Kepler-69c is likely more analogous to Venus, and thus unlikely to be habitable. [ 184 ] On May 15, 2013, NASA announced the space telescope had been crippled by failure of a reaction wheel that keeps it pointed in the right direction. A second wheel had previously failed, and the telescope required three wheels (out of four total) to be operational for the instrument to function properly. Further testing in July and August determined that while Kepler was capable of using its damaged reaction wheels to prevent itself from entering safe mode and of downlinking previously collected science data it was not capable of collecting further science data as previously configured. [ 185 ] Scientists working on the Kepler project said there was a backlog of data still to be looked at, and that more discoveries would be made in the following couple of years, despite the setback. [ 186 ] Although no new science data from Kepler field had been collected since the problem, an additional sixty-three candidates were announced in July 2013 based on the previously collected observations. [ 187 ] In November 2013, the second Kepler science conference was held. The discoveries included the median size of planet candidates getting smaller compared to early 2013, preliminary results of the discovery of a few circumbinary planets and planets in the habitable zone. [ 188 ] 2014 [ edit ] Histogram of exoplanet discoveries. The yellow shaded bar shows newly announced planets including those verified by the multiplicity technique (February 26, 2014). On February 13, over 530 additional planet candidates were announced residing around single planet systems. Several of them were nearly Earth-sized and located in the habitable zone. This number was further increased by about 400 in June 2014. [ 189 ] On February 26, scientists announced that data from Kepler had confirmed the existence of 715 new exoplanets. A new statistical method of confirmation was used called "verification by multiplicity" which is based on how many planets around multiple stars were found to be real planets. This allowed much quicker confirmation of numerous candidates which are part of multiplanetary systems. 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water . [ 101 ] [ 190 ] [ 191 ] [ 192 ] In March, a study found that small planets with orbital periods of less than one day are usually accompanied by at least one additional planet with orbital period of 1–50 days. This study also noted that ultra-short period planets are almost always smaller than 2 Earth radii unless it is a misaligned hot Jupiter. [ 193 ] On April 17, the Kepler team announced the discovery of Kepler-186f , the first nearly Earth-sized planet located in the habitable zone. This planet orbits around a red dwarf. [ 194 ] In May 2014, K2 observations fields 0 to 13 were announced and described in detail. [ 118 ] K2 observations began in June 2014. In July 2014, the first discoveries from K2 field data were reported in the form of eclipsing binaries . Discoveries were derived from a Kepler engineering data set which was collected prior to campaign 0 [ 195 ] in preparation to the main K2 mission. [ 196 ] On September 23, 2014, NASA reported that the K2 mission had completed campaign 1, [ 197 ] the first official set of science observations, and that campaign 2 [ 198 ] was underway. [ 199 ] Kepler observed KSN 2011b, a Type Ia supernova , in the process of exploding: before, during and after. [ 200 ] Campaign 3 [ 201 ] lasted from November 14, 2014, to February 6, 2015, and included "16,375 standard long cadence and 55 standard short cadence targets". [ 118 ] 2015 [ edit ] This section is in list format but may read better as prose . You can help by converting this section , if appropriate. Editing help is available. ( March 2023 ) In January 2015, the number of confirmed Kepler planets exceeded 1000. At least two ( Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b ) of the discovered planets announced that month were likely rocky and in the habitable zone . [ 40 ] Also in January 2015, NASA reported that five confirmed sub-earth-sized rocky exoplanets , all smaller than the planet Venus , were found orbiting the 11.2 billion year old star Kepler-444 , making this star system, at 80% of the age of the universe , the oldest yet discovered. [ 202 ] [ 203 ] [ 204 ] In April 2015, campaign 4 [ 205 ] was reported to last between February 7, 2015, and April 24, 2015, and to include observations of nearly 16,000 target stars and two notable open star clusters, Pleiades and Hyades. [ 206 ] In May 2015, Kepler observed a newly discovered supernova , KSN 2011b ( Type Ia ), before, during and after explosion. Details of the pre-nova moments may help scientists better understand dark energy . [ 200 ] On July 24, 2015, NASA announced the discovery of Kepler-452b , a confirmed exoplanet that is near-Earth in size and found orbiting the habitable zone of a Sun-like star. [ 207 ] [ 208 ] The seventh Kepler planet candidate catalog was released, containing 4,696 candidates, and increase of 521 candidates since the previous catalog release in January 2015. [ 209 ] [ 210 ] On September 14, 2015, astronomers reported unusual light fluctuations of KIC 8462852 , an F-type main-sequence star in the constellation Cygnus , as detected by Kepler, while searching for exoplanets . Various hypotheses have been presented, including comets , asteroids , and an alien civilization . [ 211 ] [ 212 ] [ 213 ] 2016 [ edit ] By May 10, 2016, the Kepler mission had verified 1,284 new planets. [ 41 ] Based on their size, about 550 could be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone : Kepler-560b , Kepler-705b , Kepler-1229b , Kepler-1410b , Kepler-1455b , Kepler-1544 b , Kepler-1593b , Kepler-1606b , and Kepler-1638b . [ 41 ] Data releases [ edit ] The Kepler team originally promised to release data within one year of observations. [ 214 ] However, this plan was changed after launch, with data being scheduled for release up to three years after its collection. [ 215 ] This resulted in considerable criticism, [ 216 ] [ 217 ] [ 218 ] [ 219 ] [ 220 ] leading the Kepler science team to release the third quarter of their data one year and nine months after collection. [ 221 ] The data through September 2010 (quarters 4, 5, and 6) was made public in January 2012. [ 222 ] Follow-ups by others [ edit ] Periodically, the Kepler team releases a list of candidates ( Kepler Objects of Interest , or KOIs) to the public. Using this information, a team of astronomers collected radial velocity data using the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph to confirm the existence of the candidate KOI-428b in 2010, later named Kepler-40b . [ 223 ] In 2011, the same team confirmed candidate KOI-423b, later named Kepler-39b . [ 224 ] Citizen scientist participation [ edit ] Since December 2010, Kepler mission data has been used for the Planet Hunters project, which allows volunteers to look for transit events in the light curves of Kepler images to identify planets that computer algorithms might miss. [ 225 ] By June 2011, users had found sixty-nine potential candidates that were previously unrecognized by the Kepler mission team. [ 226 ] The team has plans to publicly credit amateurs who spot such planets. In January 2012, the BBC program Stargazing Live aired a public appeal for volunteers to analyse Planethunters.org data for potential new exoplanets. This led two amateur astronomers—one in Peterborough , England—to discover a new Neptune -sized exoplanet, to be named Threapleton Holmes B. [ 227 ] One hundred thousand other volunteers were also engaged in the search by late January, analyzing over one million Kepler images by early 2012. [ 228 ] One such exoplanet, PH1b (or Kepler-64b from its Kepler designation), was discovered in 2012. A second exoplanet, PH2b (Kepler-86b) was discovered in 2013. In April 2017, ABC Stargazing Live , a variation of BBC Stargazing Live , launched the Zooniverse project "Exoplanet Explorers". While Planethunters.org worked with archived data, Exoplanet Explorers used recently downlinked data from the K2 mission. On the first day of the project, 184 transit candidates were identified that passed simple tests. On the second day, the research team identified a star system, later named K2-138 , with a Sun-like star and four super-Earths in a tight orbit. In the end, volunteers helped to identify 90 exoplanet candidates. [ 229 ] [ 230 ] The citizen scientists that helped discover the new star system will be added as co-authors in the research paper when published. [ 231 ] Confirmed exoplanets [ edit ] Main article: List of exoplanets discovered by the Kepler space telescope Main article: List of planets observed during Kepler's K2 mission See also: List of exoplanetary host stars and List of exoplanets Confirmed small exoplanets in habitable zones ( Kepler-62e , Kepler-62f , Kepler-186f , Kepler-296e , Kepler-296f , Kepler-438b , Kepler-440b , Kepler-442b ). [ 40 ] Exoplanets discovered using Kepler 's data, but confirmed by outside researchers, include Kepler-39b, [ 224 ] Kepler-40b, [ 223 ] Kepler-41b , [ 232 ] Kepler-43b , [ 233 ] Kepler-44b , [ 234 ] Kepler-45b , [ 235 ] as well as the planets orbiting Kepler-223 [ 236 ] and Kepler-42 . [ 237 ] The "KOI" acronym indicates that the star is a K epler O bject of I nterest . Kepler Input Catalog [ edit ] Main article: Kepler Input Catalog The Kepler Input Catalog is a publicly searchable database of roughly 13.2 million targets used for the Kepler Spectral Classification Program and the Kepler mission. [ 238 ] [ 239 ] The catalog alone is not used for finding Kepler targets, because only a portion of the listed stars (about one-third of the catalog) can be observed by the spacecraft. [ 238 ] Solar System observations [ edit ] Kepler has been assigned an observatory code ( C55 ) in order to report its astrometric observations of small Solar System bodies to the Minor Planet Center . In 2013 the alternative NEOKepler mission was proposed, a search for near-Earth objects , in particular potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs). Its unique orbit and larger field of view than existing survey telescopes allow it to look for objects inside Earth's orbit. It was predicted a 12-month survey could make a significant contribution to the hunt for PHAs as well as potentially locating targets for NASA's Asteroid Redirect Mission . [ 240 ] Kepler's first discovery in the Solar System, however, was (506121) 2016 BP 81 , a 200-kilometer cold classical Kuiper belt object located beyond the orbit of Neptune . [ 241 ] Retirement [ edit ] Artwork commissioned by NASA to commemorate the retirement of Kepler in October–November 2018. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] On October 30, 2018, NASA announced that the Kepler space telescope, having run out of fuel, and after nine years of service and the discovery of over 2,600 exoplanets , has been officially retired, and will maintain its current, safe orbit, away from Earth. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The spacecraft was deactivated with a "goodnight" command sent from the mission's control center at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics on November 15, 2018. [ 242 ] Kepler's retirement coincides with the 388th anniversary of Johannes Kepler 's death in 1630.

It is the largest telescope in space, and is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant , or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope . [ 9 ] This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology , such as observation of the first stars and the formation of the first galaxies , and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Despite the Webb's mirror diameter being 2.7 times larger than that of the Hubble Space Telescope, it produces images of comparable resolution because it observes in the infrared spectrum, which has longer wavelengths than the Hubble's visible spectrum. The longer the wavelength the telescope is designed to observe, the larger the information-gathering surface (mirrors in the infrared spectrum or antenna area in the millimeter and radio ranges) required to achieve the desired resolution. The Webb was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou , French Guiana. In January 2022, it arrived at its destination, a solar orbit near the Sun–Earth L 2 Lagrange point , about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 mi) from Earth. The telescope's first image was released to the public on 11 July 2022. [ 13 ] The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led Webb's design and development and partnered with two central agencies: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland managed telescope development, while the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University operates Webb. The primary contractor for the project was Northrop Grumman . The telescope is named after James E. Webb , who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury , Gemini , and Apollo programs. Webb's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold -plated beryllium , which together create a 6.5-meter-diameter (21 ft) mirror, compared with Hubble's 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). This gives Webb a light-collecting area of about 25 m 2 (270 sq ft), about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet , visible , and near infrared spectra (0.1–2.5 μm ), [ 14 ] Webb observes a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6–28.5 μm). [ 15 ] The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below 50 K (−223 °C; −370 °F), so that the infrared radiation emitted by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. Its five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon. Initial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, began in 1996. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program saw enormous cost overruns and delays. A significant redesign was carried out in 2005, with construction completed in 2016, followed by years of exhaustive testing, at a total cost of US$10 billion. Features [ edit ] The mass of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is about half that of the Hubble Space Telescope . Webb has a 6.5-meter-diameter (21-foot) gold-coated beryllium primary mirror made up of 18 separate hexagonal mirrors. The mirror has a polished area of 26.3 m 2 (283 ft 2 ), of which 0.9 m 2 (9.7 ft 2 ) is obscured by the secondary support struts, [ 16 ] giving a total collecting area of 25.4 m 2 (273 ft 2 ). This is over six times larger than the collecting area of Hubble's 2.4 m (7.9 ft) diameter mirror, which has a collecting area of 4.0 m 2 (43 ft 2 ). The mirror has a gold coating to provide infrared reflectivity , covered by a thin layer of glass for durability. [ 17 ] Webb is designed primarily for near- infrared astronomy , but can also detect orange and red visible light and the mid-infrared region, depending on the instrument used. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] It can detect objects up to 100 times fainter than Hubble can, and objects much earlier in the history of the universe , back to redshift z≈20 (about 180 million years cosmic time after the Big Bang ). [ 18 ] For comparison, the earliest stars are thought to have formed between z≈30 and z≈20 (100–180 million years cosmic time), [ 19 ] and the first galaxies may have formed around redshift z≈15 (about 270 million years cosmic time). Hubble is unable to see further back than very early reionization [ 20 ] [ 21 ] at about z≈11.1 (galaxy GN-z11 , 400 million years cosmic time). [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 18 ] The design emphasizes the near to mid-infrared for several reasons: high-redshift (very early and distant) objects have their visible emissions shifted into the infrared, and therefore their light can be observed only via infrared astronomy; [ 14 ] infrared light passes more easily through dust clouds than visible light; [ 14 ] colder objects such as debris disks and planets emit most strongly in the infrared; These infrared bands are difficult to study from the ground or by earlier space telescopes such as Hubble. Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric absorption (or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light Ground-based telescopes must look through Earth's atmosphere , which is opaque in many infrared bands (see figure at right). Even where the atmosphere is transparent, many of the target chemical compounds, such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane , are present in the Earth's atmosphere and interfere with observations. Existing space telescopes, such as Hubble, cannot study these bands since their mirrors are at a temperature high enough to emit significant infrared radiation; for example, the Hubble mirror is maintained at about 15 °C [288 K; 59 °F], so that the telescope itself radiates strongly in the relevant infrared bands. [ 24 ] Webb can also observe objects in the Solar System at angles greater than 85° from the Sun and with apparent angular rate of motion less than 0.03 arc seconds per second. [ a ] This includes Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, their satellites , and comets , asteroids and minor planets at or beyond the orbit of Mars . Webb has sufficient near-IR and mid-IR sensitivity to be able to observe virtually all known Kuiper Belt Objects . [ 19 ] [ 28 ] In addition, it can observe opportunistic and unplanned targets such as supernovae and gamma ray bursts within 48 hours of a decision to do so. [ 19 ] Three-quarter view of the top Bottom (Sun-facing side) Location and orbit [ edit ] Webb operates in a halo orbit , circling a point in space known as the Sun–Earth L 2 Lagrange point , approximately 1,500,000 km (930,000 mi) beyond Earth's orbit around the Sun. Its actual position varies between about 250,000 and 832,000 km (155,000–517,000 mi) from L 2 as it orbits, keeping it out of both Earth and Moon's shadow. By way of comparison, Hubble orbits 550 km (340 mi) above Earth's surface, and the Moon is roughly 400,000 km (250,000 mi) from Earth. Objects near this Sun–Earth L 2 point can orbit the Sun in synchrony with the Earth, allowing the telescope to remain at a roughly constant distance [ 29 ] with continuous orientation of its sunshield and equipment bus toward the Sun, Earth and Moon. Combined with its wide, shadow-avoiding orbit, the telescope can simultaneously block incoming heat and light from all three bodies and avoid even the most minor changes in temperature from Earth and Moon shadows that would affect the structure, while maintaining uninterrupted solar power and Earth communications on its Sun-facing side. This arrangement keeps the temperature of the spacecraft constant and below the 50 K (−223 °C; −370 °F) necessary for faint infrared observations. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Sunshield protection [ edit ] Main article: James Webb Space Telescope sunshield Test unit of the sunshield stacked and expanded at the Northrop Grumman facility in California, 2014 To make observations in the infrared spectrum, Webb must be kept under 50 K (−223.2 °C; −369.7 °F); otherwise, infrared radiation from the telescope itself would overwhelm its instruments. Its large sunshield blocks light and heat from the Sun, Earth, and Moon, and its position near the Sun–Earth L 2 keeps all three bodies on the same side of the spacecraft at all times. [ 32 ] Its halo orbit around the L 2 point avoids the shadow of the Earth and Moon, maintaining a constant environment for the sunshield and solar arrays. [ 29 ] The resulting stable temperature for the structures on the dark side is critical to maintaining precise alignment of the primary mirror segments. [ 30 ] The sunshield consists of five layers, each approximately as thin as a human hair. [ 33 ] Each layer is made of Kapton E film, coated with aluminum on both sides. The two outermost layers have an additional coating of doped silicon on the Sun-facing sides, to better reflect the Sun's heat into space. [ 30 ] The sunshield has an effective sun protection factor, or SPF, of 1,000,000, compared to suntan lotion with a range of 8 to 50. [ 34 ] Accidental tears of the delicate film structure during deployment testing in 2018 led to further delays to the telescope deployment. [ 35 ] The sunshield was designed to be folded twelve times so that it would fit within the Ariane 5 rocket's payload fairing , which is 4.57 m (15.0 ft) in diameter, and 16.19 m (53.1 ft) long. The shield's fully deployed dimensions were planned as 14.162 m × 21.197 m (46.46 ft × 69.54 ft). [ 36 ] Keeping within the shadow of the sunshield limits the field of regard of Webb at any given time. The telescope can see 40 percent of the sky from any one position, but can see all of the sky over a period of six months. [ 37 ] Optics [ edit ] Main article: Optical Telescope Element Engineers cleaning a test mirror with carbon dioxide snow , 2015 Main mirror assembly from the front with primary mirrors attached, November 2016 Diffraction spikes due to mirror segments and spider color-coded Webb's primary mirror is a 6.5 m (21 ft)-diameter gold-coated beryllium reflector with a collecting area of 25.4 m 2 (273 sq ft). If it had been designed as a single, large mirror, it would have been too large for existing launch vehicles. The mirror is therefore composed of 18 hexagonal segments (a technique pioneered by Guido Horn d'Arturo ), which unfolded after the telescope was launched. Image plane wavefront sensing via phase retrieval is used to position the mirror segments at the correct locations using precise actuators . After this initial configuration, they only need occasional updates every few days to maintain optimal focus. [ 38 ] This is unlike terrestrial telescopes, for example the Keck telescopes , which must continually adjust their mirror segments using active optics to overcome the effects of gravitational and wind loading. [ 39 ] The Webb telescope uses 132 small actuation motors to position and adjust the optics. [ 40 ] The actuators can position the mirror with 10 nanometer accuracy. [ 41 ] Webb's optical design is a three-mirror anastigmat , [ 42 ] which makes use of curved secondary and tertiary mirrors to deliver images that are free from optical aberrations over a wide field. The secondary mirror is 0.74 m (2.4 ft) in diameter. In addition, there is a fine steering mirror which can adjust its position many times per second to provide image stabilization . Point light sources in images taken by Webb have six diffraction spikes plus two fainter ones, due to the hexagonal shape of the primary mirror segments. [ 43 ] Scientific instruments [ edit ] NIRCam wrapped up in 2013 The Calibration Assembly, one component of the NIRSpec instrument MIRI The Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) is a framework that provides electrical power, computing resources, cooling capability, and structural stability to the Webb telescope. It is made with a bonded graphite-epoxy composite attached to the underside of Webb's telescope structure. The ISIM holds the four science instruments and a guide camera. [ 44 ] NIRCam (Near Infrared Camera) is an infrared imager which has spectral coverage ranging from the edge of the visible (0.6 μm) through to the near infrared (5 μm). [ 45 ] [ 46 ] There are 10 sensors each of 4 megapixels. NIRCam serves as the observatory's wavefront sensor, required for wavefront sensing and control activities that align and focus the main mirror segments. NIRCam was built by a team led by the University of Arizona , with principal investigator Marcia J. Rieke . [ 47 ] NIRSpec (Near Infrared Spectrograph) performs spectroscopy over the same wavelength range. It was built by the European Space Agency (ESA) at ESTEC in Noordwijk , Netherlands. The leading development team includes members from Airbus Defence and Space in Ottobrunn and Friedrichshafen, Germany, and the Goddard Space Flight Center , with Pierre Ferruit ( École normale supérieure de Lyon ) as NIRSpec project scientist. The NIRSpec design provides three observing modes: a low-resolution prism mode, an R~1000 multi-object mode, and an R~2700 integral-field unit or long-slit spectroscopy mode. Mode switching is performed by operating a wavelength preselection mechanism, the Filter Wheel Assembly, and selecting a corresponding dispersive element (prism or grating) using the Grating Wheel Assembly. Both mechanisms are based on the successful ISOPHOT wheel mechanisms of the Infrared Space Observatory . The multi-object mode relies on a complex microshutter mechanism to enable simultaneous observations of hundreds of individual objects across NIRSpec's field of view. There are two sensors, each of 4 megapixels. [ 48 ] MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) measures the mid-to-long-infrared wavelength range from 5 to 27 μm. [ 49 ] [ 50 ] It contains both a mid-infrared camera and an imaging spectrometer . [ 51 ] MIRI was developed as a collaboration between NASA and a consortium of European countries, and is led by George Rieke (University of Arizona) and Gillian Wright ( UK Astronomy Technology Centre , Edinburgh , Scotland). [ 47 ] The temperature of the MIRI must not exceed 6 K (−267 °C; −449 °F): a helium gas mechanical cooler sited on the warm side of the environmental shield provides this cooling. [ 52 ] FGS/NIRISS (Fine Guidance Sensor and Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph), led by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) under project scientist John Hutchings ( Herzberg Astronomy and Astrophysics Research Centre ), is used to stabilize the line-of-sight of the observatory during science observations. Measurements from the FGS are used both to control the spacecraft's overall orientation and to drive the fine steering mirror for image stabilization. The CSA also provided a Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) module for astronomical imaging and spectroscopy in the 0.8 to 5 μm wavelength range, led by principal investigator René Doyon [ 53 ] at the Université de Montréal . [ 47 ] Although they are often referred together as a unit, the NIRISS and FGS serve entirely different purposes, with one being a scientific instrument. The other is a part of the observatory's support infrastructure. [ 54 ] NIRCam and MIRI feature starlight-blocking coronagraphs for observation of faint targets such as extrasolar planets and circumstellar disks very close to bright stars. [ 50 ] Spacecraft bus [ edit ] Main article: Spacecraft bus (James Webb Space Telescope) JWST major components: spacecraft bus, sunshield, Optical Telescope Element (OTE), and the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) The spacecraft bus is the primary support component of the JWST, hosting a multitude of subsystems for computing, communications, electrical power, propulsion, and structure. [ 55 ] Along with the sunshield, it forms the spacecraft element of the space telescope . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] The spacecraft bus is on the Sun-facing "warm" side of the sunshield and operates at a temperature of about 300 K (27 °C; 80 °F). [ 56 ] The spacecraft bus has a mass of 350 kg (770 lb) and must support the 6,200 kg (13,700 lb) space telescope. It is primarily made of a graphite composite material. [ 58 ] The assembly was completed in California in 2015. It was integrated with the rest of the space telescope, leading to its 2021 launch. The spacecraft bus can rotate the telescope with pointing precision of one arcsecond and isolates vibration to 2 milliarcseconds. [ 59 ] Webb has two pairs of rocket engines (one pair for redundancy) to make course corrections on the way to L 2 and for station keeping – maintaining the correct position in the halo orbit. Eight smaller thrusters are used for attitude control – the correct pointing of the spacecraft. [ 60 ] The engines use hydrazine fuel (159 liters or 42 U.S. gallons at launch) and dinitrogen tetroxide as oxidizer (79.5 liters or 21.0 U.S. gallons at launch). [ 61 ] Servicing [ edit ] Webb is not intended to be serviced in space. A crewed mission to repair or upgrade the observatory, as was done for Hubble, would not be possible, [ 62 ] and according to NASA Associate Administrator Thomas Zurbuchen , despite best efforts, an uncrewed remote mission was found to be beyond available technology at the time Webb was designed. [ 63 ] During the long Webb testing period, NASA officials referred to the idea of a servicing mission, but no plans were announced. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Since the successful launch, NASA has stated that nevertheless limited accommodation was made to facilitate future servicing missions. These accommodations included precise guidance markers in the form of crosses on the surface of Webb, for use by remote servicing missions, as well as refillable fuel tanks, removable heat protectors, and accessible attachment points. [ 66 ] [ 63 ] Software [ edit ] Webb uses a modified version of JavaScript , called Nombas ScriptEase 5.00e, for its operations; it follows the ECMAScript standard and "allows for a modular design flow, where on-board scripts call lower-level scripts that are defined as functions". Furthermore, "The script interpreter is run by the flight software, which is written in C++ . The flight software operates the spacecraft and the science instruments." [ 67 ] Comparison with other telescopes [ edit ] Comparison with the Hubble Space Telescope primary mirror Primary mirror size comparison between Webb and Hubble The desire for a large infrared space telescope is decades old. In the United States, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (later called the Spitzer Space Telescope ) was planned while the Space Shuttle was in development, and the potential for infrared astronomy was acknowledged at that time. [ 68 ] Unlike ground telescopes, space observatories are free from atmospheric absorption of infrared light. Space observatories opened a "new sky" for astronomers. However, there is a challenge in the design of infrared telescopes: they must remain extremely cold, and the longer the wavelength of infrared light, the colder they must be. If not, the device's background heat overwhelms the detectors, effectively rendering it blind. This can be overcome by careful design. One method is to put the key instruments in a dewar with an icy substance, such as liquid helium . The coolant will slowly vaporize, limiting the instrument's lifetime to as short as a few months or as long as a few years. [ 24 ] It is also possible to maintain a low temperature by designing the spacecraft to enable near-infrared observations without coolant, as with the extended missions of the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer , which operated at reduced capacity after coolant depletion. Another example is Hubble's Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) instrument, which started out using a block of nitrogen ice that depleted after a couple of years, but was then replaced during the STS-109 servicing mission with a cryocooler that worked continuously. The Webb Space Telescope is designed to cool itself without a dewar, using a combination of sunshields and radiators, with the mid-infrared instrument using an additional cryocooler. [ 69 ] Selected space telescopes and instruments [ 70 ] Name Launch year Wavelength (μm) Aperture (m) Cooling Spacelab Infrared Telescope (IRT) 1985 1.7–118 0.15 Helium Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) [ 71 ] 1995 2.5–240 0.60 Helium Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) 1997 0.115–1.03 2.4 Passive Hubble Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) 1997 0.8–2.4 2.4 Nitrogen, later cryocooler Spitzer Space Telescope 2003 3–180 0.85 Helium Hubble Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) 2009 0.2–1.7 2.4 Passive and thermo-electric [ 72 ] Herschel Space Observatory 2009 55–672 3.5 Helium James Webb Space Telescope 2021 0.6–28.5 6.5 Passive and cryocooler (MIRI) Webb's delays and cost increases have been compared to those of its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope . When Hubble formally began in 1972, it had an estimated development cost of US$300 million (equivalent to $2,309,069,000 in 2025), but by the time it was launched in 1990, the cost was about four times that. In addition, new instruments and servicing missions increased the price to at least US$9 billion by 2006 [ 73 ] (equivalent to $14,373,556,000 in 2025). Development history [ edit ] For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the James Webb Space Telescope . Background (development to 2003) [ edit ] Major milestones Year Milestone 1996 Next Generation Space Telescope project first proposed (mirror size: 8 m) 2001 NEXUS Space Telescope, a precursor to the Next Generation Space Telescope, cancelled [ 74 ] 2002 Proposed project renamed James Webb Space Telescope, (mirror size reduced to 6 m) 2003 Northrop Grumman awarded contract to build telescope 2007 Memorandum of Understanding signed between NASA and ESA [ 75 ] 2010 Mission Critical Design Review (MCDR) passed 2011 Proposed cancellation 2016 Final assembly completed 25 Dec 2021 Launch Discussions of a Hubble follow-on started in the 1980s, but serious planning began in the early 1990s. [ 76 ] The Hi-Z telescope concept was developed between 1989 and 1994: [ 77 ] a fully baffled [ b ] 4 m (13 ft) aperture infrared telescope that would recede to an orbit at 3 astronomical unit (AU). [ 78 ] This distant orbit would have benefited from reduced light noise from zodiacal dust . [ 78 ] Other early plans called for a NEXUS precursor telescope mission. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] Correcting the flawed optics of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in its first years played a significant role in the birth of Webb. [ 81 ] In 1993, NASA conducted STS-61 , the Space Shuttle mission that replaced HST's camera and installed a retrofit for its imaging spectrograph to compensate for the spherical aberration in its primary mirror . The HST & Beyond Committee was formed in 1994 "to study possible missions and programs for optical-ultraviolet astronomy in space for the first decades of the 21st century". [ 82 ] Emboldened by HST's success, its 1996 report explored the concept of a larger and much colder, infrared-sensitive telescope that could reach back in cosmic time to the birth of the first galaxies. This high-priority science goal was beyond the HST's capability because, as a warm telescope, it is blinded by infrared emission from its own optical system. In addition to recommendations to extend the HST mission to 2005 and to develop technologies for finding planets around other stars, NASA embraced the chief recommendation of HST & Beyond [ 83 ] for a large, cold space telescope (radiatively cooled far below 0 °C), and began the planning process for the future Webb telescope. Preparation for the 2000 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey (a literature review produced by the United States National Research Council that includes identifying research priorities and making recommendations for the upcoming decade) included further development of the scientific program for what became known as the Next Generation Space Telescope, [ 84 ] and advancements in relevant technologies by NASA. As it matured, studying the birth of galaxies in the young universe and searching for planets around other stars – the prime goals coalesced into "Origins" by HST & Beyond becoming prominent. [ 83 ] As hoped, the NGST received the highest ranking in the 2000 Decadal Survey. [ 85 ] An administrator of NASA , Dan Goldin , coined the phrase " faster, better, cheaper ", and opted for the next big paradigm shift for astronomy, namely, breaking the barrier of a single mirror. That meant going from "eliminate moving parts" to "learn to live with moving parts" (i.e., segmented optics). To reduce mass density by a factor of 10, silicon carbide with a skinny glass layer on top was initially considered, but beryllium was ultimately selected. [ 76 ] The mid-1990s era of "faster, better, cheaper" produced the NGST concept, with an 8 m (26 ft) aperture to be flown to L 2 , roughly estimated to cost US$500 million. [ 86 ] In 1997, NASA worked with the Goddard Space Flight Center, [ 87 ] Ball Aerospace & Technologies , [ 88 ] and TRW [ 89 ] to conduct technical requirement and cost studies of the three different concepts, and in 1999 selected Lockheed Martin [ 90 ] and TRW for preliminary concept studies. [ 91 ] Launch was at that time planned for 2007, but the launch date was pushed back many times (see table further down ). In 2002, the project was renamed after NASA's second administrator (1961–1968), James E. Webb (1906–1992). [ 92 ] Webb led the agency during the Apollo program and established scientific research as a core NASA activity. [ 93 ] In 2003, NASA awarded TRW the US$824.8 million prime contract for the Webb telescope. The design called for a de-scoped 6.1 m (20 ft) primary mirror and a launch date of 2010. [ 94 ] Later that year, TRW was acquired by Northrop Grumman in a hostile bid and became Northrop Grumman Space Technology. [ 91 ] Early development and replanning (2003–2007) [ edit ] Early full-scale model on display at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (2005) Development was managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, with John C. Mather as its project scientist. The primary contractor was Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, responsible for developing and building the spacecraft element, which included the satellite bus , sunshield, Deployable Tower Assembly (DTA) which connects the Optical Telescope Element to the spacecraft bus, and the Mid Boom Assembly (MBA) which helps to deploy the large sunshields on orbit, [ 95 ] while Ball Aerospace & Technologies was subcontracted to develop and build the OTE itself, and the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM). [ 44 ] Cost growth revealed in spring 2005 led to a re-planning in August 2005. [ 96 ] The primary technical outcomes of the re-planning were significant changes in the integration and test plans, a 22-month launch delay (from 2011 to 2013), and elimination of system-level testing for observatory modes at wavelengths shorter than 1.7 μm. Other major features of the observatory were unchanged. Following the re-planning, the project was independently reviewed in April 2006. [ 97 ] In the 2005 re-plan, the project's life-cycle cost was estimated at US$4.5 billion. This comprised approximately US$3.5 billion for design, development, launch, and commissioning, and approximately US$1.0 billion for ten years of operations. [ 96 ] The ESA agreed in 2004 to contributing about €300 million, including the launch. [ 98 ] The CSA pledged CA$39 million in 2007 [ 99 ] and in 2012 delivered its contributions in equipment to point the telescope and detect atmospheric conditions on distant planets. [ 100 ] Detailed design and construction (2007–2021) [ edit ] A JWST mirror segment, 2010 Mirror segments undergoing cryogenic tests at the X-ray & Cryogenic Facility at Marshall Space Flight Center The assembled telescope following environmental testing In January 2007, nine of the ten technology development items in the project successfully passed a Non-Advocate Review. [ 101 ] These technologies were deemed sufficiently mature to mitigate significant risks in the project. The remaining technology development item (the MIRI cryocooler) completed its technology maturation milestone in April 2007. This technology review represented the beginning step in the process that ultimately moved the project into its detailed design phase (Phase C). By May 2007, costs were still on target. [ 102 ] In March 2008, the project completed its Preliminary Design Review (PDR). In April 2008, the project passed the Non-Advocate Review. Other past reviews include the Integrated Science Instrument Module review in March 2009, the Optical Telescope Element review completed in October 2009, and the Sunshield review completed in January 2010. [ 103 ] In April 2010, the telescope passed the technical portion of its Mission Critical Design Review (MCDR). Passing the MCDR signified that the integrated observatory could meet all science and engineering requirements for its mission. [ 104 ] The MCDR encompassed all previous design reviews. The project schedule underwent review during the months following the MCDR through the Independent Comprehensive Review Panel, which led to a re-plan of the mission aiming for a 2015 launch, but it was not until 2018. By 2010, cost overruns were impacting other projects, though Webb itself remained on schedule. [ 105 ] By 2011, the Webb project was in the final design and fabrication phase (Phase C). Assembly of the hexagonal segments of the primary mirror, which was done via robotic arm, began in November 2015 and was completed on 3 February 2016. The secondary mirror was installed on 3 March 2016. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Final construction of the Webb telescope was completed in November 2016, after which extensive testing procedures began. [ 108 ] In March 2018, NASA delayed Webb's launch by an additional 2 years to May 2020 after the telescope's sunshield ripped during a practice deployment, and its cables did not sufficiently tighten. In June 2018, NASA delayed the launch by an additional 10 months to March 2021, based on the independent review board's assessment following the failed March 2018 test deployment. [ 109 ] The review identified that Webb launch and deployment had 344 potential single-point failures – tasks that had no alternative or means of recovery if unsuccessful, and therefore had to succeed for the telescope to work. [ 110 ] In August 2019, the mechanical integration of the telescope was completed, something that was scheduled to be done 12 years before in 2007. [ 111 ] After construction was completed, Webb underwent final tests at Northrop Grumman's historic Space Park in Redondo Beach, California. [ 112 ] A ship carrying the telescope left California on 26 September 2021, passed through the Panama Canal , and arrived in French Guiana on 12 October 2021. [ 113 ] Cost and schedule issues [ edit ] NASA's lifetime cost for the project is [ when? ] expected to be US$9.7 billion, of which US$8.8 billion was spent on spacecraft design and development, and US$861 million is planned to support five years of mission operations. [ 114 ] Representatives from ESA and CSA stated their project contributions amount to approximately €700 million and CA$200 million, respectively. [ 115 ] A 1984 study by the Space Science Board estimated that building a next-generation infrared observatory in orbit would cost US$4 billion (US$7B in 2006 dollars, or US$ 10B in 2020 dollars). [ 73 ] While this came close to the final cost of Webb, the first NASA design considered in the late 1990s was more modest, aiming for a $1 billion price tag over 10 years of construction. Over time, this design expanded, added funding for contingencies, and had scheduling delays. Progression of estimates for schedule and cost, along with major milestones Year Planned launch Budget plan (billion USD) 1998 2007 [ 116 ] 1 [ 73 ] 2000 2009 [ 49 ] 1.8 [ 73 ] 2002 2010 [ 117 ] 2.5 [ 73 ] 2003 2011 [ 118 ] 2.5 [ 73 ] 2005 2013 3 [ 119 ] 2006 2014 4.5 [ 120 ] 2008: Preliminary Design Review 2008 2014 5.1 [ 121 ] 2010: Critical Design Review 2010 2015 to 2016 6.5 [ 122 ] 2011 2018 8.7 [ 123 ] 2017 2019 [ 124 ] 8.8 2018 2020 [ 125 ] ≥8.8 2019 March 2021 [ 126 ] 9.66 2021 Dec 2021 [ 127 ] 9.70 By 2008, when the project entered preliminary design review and was formally confirmed for construction, over US$1 billion had already been spent on developing the telescope, and the total budget was estimated at US$5 billion (equivalent to $8.24 billion in 2025). [ 128 ] In summer 2010, the mission passed its Critical Design Review (CDR) with excellent grades on all technical matters. Still, schedule and cost slips at that time prompted Maryland U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski to call for an external review of the project. The Independent Comprehensive Review Panel (ICRP), chaired by J. Casani (JPL), found that the earliest possible launch date was late 2015, at an additional cost of US$1.5 billion (bringing the total to US$6.5 billion). They also noted that this would have required additional funding in FY2011 and FY2012, and that a later launch date would result in a higher total cost. [ 122 ] On 6 July 2011, the United States House of Representatives' appropriations committee on Commerce, Justice, and Science moved to cancel the James Webb project by proposing an FY2012 budget that removed US$1.9 billion from NASA's overall budget, of which roughly one quarter was for Webb. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] [ 131 ] [ 132 ] US$3 billion had been spent and 75% of its hardware was in production. [ 133 ] This budget proposal was approved by subcommittee vote the following day. The committee charged that the project was "billions of dollars over budget and plagued by poor management". [ 129 ] In response, the American Astronomical Society stated support of Webb, [ 134 ] as did Senator Mikulski. [ 135 ] A number of editorials supporting Webb appeared in the international press during 2011 as well. [ 129 ] [ 136 ] [ 137 ] In November 2011, Congress reversed plans to cancel Webb and instead capped additional funding to complete the project at US$8 billion. [ 138 ] While similar issues had affected other major NASA projects such as the Hubble telescope, some scientists expressed concerns about growing costs and schedule delays for the Webb telescope, worrying that its budget might be competing with those of other space science programs. [ 139 ] [ 140 ] A 2010 Nature article described Webb as "the telescope that ate astronomy". [ 141 ] NASA continued to defend the budget and timeline of the program to Congress. [ 140 ] [ 142 ] In 2018, Gregory L. Robinson was appointed as the new director of the Webb program. [ 143 ] Robinson was credited with raising the program's schedule efficiency (how many measures were completed on time) from 50% to 95%. [ 143 ] For his role in improving the performance of the Webb program, Robinsons's supervisor, Thomas Zurbuchen , called him "the most effective leader of a mission I have ever seen in the history of NASA". [ 143 ] In July 2022, after Webb's commissioning process was complete and it began transmitting its first data, Robinson retired following a 33-year career at NASA. [ 144 ] On 27 March 2018, NASA pushed back the launch to May 2020 or later, [ 125 ] with a final cost estimate to come after a new launch window was determined with the ESA. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ] In 2019, its mission cost cap was increased by US$800 million. [ 148 ] After launch windows were paused in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic , [ 149 ] Webb was launched at the end of 2021, with a total cost of just under US$10 billion. No single area drove the cost. For future large telescopes, there are five major areas critical to controlling overall cost: [ 150 ] System complexity Critical path and overhead Verification challenges Programmatic constraints Early integration and test considerations Partnership [ edit ] NASA, ESA, and CSA have collaborated on the telescope since 1996. ESA's participation in construction and launch was approved by its members in 2003, and an agreement was signed between ESA and NASA in 2007. In exchange for full partnership, representation, and access to the observatory for its astronomers, ESA is providing the NIRSpec instrument, the Optical Bench Assembly of the MIRI instrument, an Ariane 5 ECA launcher, and a workforce to support operations. [ 98 ] [ 151 ] The CSA provided the Fine Guidance Sensor and the Near-Infrared Imager Slitless Spectrograph and workforce to support operations. [ 152 ] Several thousand scientists, engineers, and technicians spanning 15 countries have contributed to the build, test, and integration of Webb. [ 153 ] A total of 258 companies, government agencies, and academic institutions participated in the pre-launch project; 142 from the United States, 104 from 12 European countries (including 21 from the U.K., 16 from France, 12 from Germany and 7 international), [ 154 ] and 12 from Canada. [ 153 ] Other countries as NASA partners, such as Australia, were involved in post-launch operation. [ 155 ] Participating countries: Austria Belgium Canada Czech Republic Denmark Finland France Germany Greece Ireland Italy Luxembourg Netherlands Norway Portugal Spain Sweden Switzerland United Kingdom United States Naming concerns [ edit ] See also: James E. Webb § NASA , and James E. Webb § Legacy In 2002, NASA administrator (2001–2004) Sean O'Keefe decided to name the telescope after James E. Webb , the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury , Gemini , and much of the Apollo programs . [ 92 ] [ 93 ] In 2015, concerns were raised around Webb's possible role in the lavender scare , the mid-20th-century persecution by the U.S. government targeting homosexuals in federal employment . [ 156 ] [ 157 ] In 2022, NASA released a report of an investigation, [ 158 ] based on an examination of more than 50,000 documents. The report found "no available evidence directly links Webb to any actions or follow-up related to the firing of individuals for their sexual orientation", either in his time in the State Department or at NASA. [ 159 ] [ 160 ] Mission goals [ edit ] The James Webb Space Telescope has four key goals: to search for light from the first stars and galaxies that formed in the universe after the Big Bang to study galaxy formation and evolution to understand star formation and planet formation to study planetary systems and the origins of life [ 161 ] These goals can be achieved more effectively through near-infrared observation rather than in the visible spectrum. For this reason, Webb's instruments will not measure visible or ultraviolet light like the Hubble Telescope, but will have a much greater capacity to perform infrared astronomy . Webb will be sensitive to a range of wavelengths from 0.6 to 28 μm (corresponding respectively to orange light and deep infrared radiation at about 100 K or −173 °C). Webb may be used to gather information on the dimming of the star KIC 8462852 , which was discovered in 2015 and shows some abnormal light-curve properties. [ 162 ] Additionally, it will be able to tell if an exoplanet has methane in its atmosphere, allowing astronomers to determine whether or not the methane is a biosignature . [ 163 ] [ 164 ] Orbit design [ edit ] Webb is not exactly at the L 2 point, but circles around it in a halo orbit . Alternative Hubble Space Telescope views of the Carina Nebula , comparing ultraviolet and visible (top) and infrared (bottom) astronomy. Far more stars are visible in the latter. Webb orbits the Sun near the second Lagrange point (L 2 ) of the Sun–Earth system, which is 1,500,000 km (930,000 mi) farther from the Sun than the Earth's orbit, and about four times farther than the Moon's orbit. Usually, an object circling the Sun farther out than Earth would take longer than one year to complete its orbit. But near the L 2 point, the combined gravitational pull of the Earth and the Sun allows a spacecraft to orbit the Sun in the same time it takes the Earth to orbit the Sun. Staying close to Earth allows much higher data rates for a given antenna size. The telescope circles about the Sun–Earth L 2 point in a halo orbit , which is inclined with respect to the ecliptic , has a radius varying between about 250,000 km (160,000 mi) and 832,000 km (517,000 mi), and takes about half a year to complete. [ 29 ] Since L 2 is just an equilibrium point with no gravitational pull, a halo orbit is not an orbit in the usual sense: the spacecraft is actually in orbit around the Sun. The halo orbit can be thought of as controlled drifting to remain in the vicinity of the L 2 point. [ 165 ] This requires some station-keeping : around 2.5 m/s per year [ 166 ] from the total ∆ v budget of 93 m/s . [ 167 ] : 10 Two sets of thrusters constitute the observatory's propulsion system. [ 168 ] Because the thrusters are located solely on the Sun-facing side of the observatory, all station-keeping operations are designed to slightly undershoot the required amount of thrust in order to avoid pushing Webb beyond the semi-stable L 2 point, a situation which would be unrecoverable. Randy Kimble, the Integration and Test Project Scientist for the JWST, compared the precise station-keeping of Webb to " Sisyphus [...] rolling this rock up the gentle slope near the top of the hill – we never want it to roll over the crest and get away from him". [ 169 ] Animation of James Webb Space Telescope trajectory Top view Side view Side view from the Sun James Webb Space Telescope · Earth · L 2 point Infrared astronomy [ edit ] Infrared observations can see objects hidden in visible light, such as the HUDF-JD2 shown here. Atmospheric windows in the infrared: Much of this type of light is blocked when viewed from the Earth's surface. It would be like looking at a rainbow but only seeing one color. Webb is the formal successor to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and since its primary emphasis is on infrared astronomy , it is also a successor to the Spitzer Space Telescope . Webb will far surpass both those telescopes, enabling it to see many more, and much older, stars and galaxies. [ 170 ] Observing in the infrared spectrum is a key technique for achieving this, because of cosmological redshift , and because it better penetrates obscuring dust and gas. This allows observation of dimmer, cooler objects. Since water vapor and carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere strongly absorb most infrared radiation, ground-based infrared astronomy is limited to narrow wavelength ranges where the atmosphere absorbs less strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere itself radiates in the infrared, often overwhelming the light from the observed object. This makes a space telescope preferable for infrared observation. [ 171 ] The more distant an object is, the younger it appears; its light has taken longer to reach human observers. Because the universe is expanding , as light travels, it becomes redshifted, and objects at great distances are therefore easier to see in the infrared. [ 172 ] Webb's infrared capabilities are expected to let it see back in time to the first galaxies forming just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. [ 173 ] Infrared radiation can pass more freely through regions of cosmic dust that scatter visible light. Observations in infrared allow the study of objects and regions of space which would be obscured by gas and dust in the visible spectrum , [ 172 ] such as the molecular clouds where stars are born, the circumstellar disks that give rise to planets, and the cores of active galaxies . [ 172 ] Relatively calm objects (temperatures less than several thousand degrees) emit their radiation primarily in the infrared, as described by Planck's law . As a result, most objects that are cooler than stars are better studied in the infrared. [ 172 ] This includes the clouds of the interstellar medium , brown dwarfs , planets both in our own and other solar systems, comets , and Kuiper belt objects that will be observed with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). [ 49 ] [ 173 ] Some of the missions in infrared astronomy that impacted Webb development were Spitzer and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). [ 174 ] Spitzer showed the importance of mid-infrared, which is helpful for tasks such as observing dust disks around stars. [ 174 ] Also, the WMAP probe showed the universe was "lit up" at redshift 17, further underscoring the importance of the mid-infrared. [ 174 ] Both these missions were launched in the early 2000s, in time to influence Webb development. [ 174 ] Ground support and operations [ edit ] The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), in Baltimore, Maryland , on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University , was selected in 2003 as the Science and Operations Center (S&OC) for Webb with an initial budget of US$162.2 million intended to support operations through the first year after launch. [ 175 ] In this capacity, STScI was to be responsible for the scientific operation of the telescope and delivery of data products to the astronomical community. Data was to be transmitted from Webb to the ground via the NASA Deep Space Network , processed and calibrated at STScI, and then distributed online to astronomers worldwide. As with Hubble, anyone, anywhere in the world, will be allowed to submit proposals for observations. Each year, several astronomy committees will peer review submitted proposals to select the projects to observe the following year. The authors of the selected proposals will typically have 1 year of private access to the new observations, after which the data will become publicly available for download from the STScI online archive. [ 176 ] The bandwidth and digital throughput of the satellite are designed to operate at 458 gigabits of data per day for the length of the mission (equivalent to a sustained rate of 5.42 Mbps ). [ 40 ] Most of the data processing on the telescope is done by conventional single-board computers. [ 177 ] The digitization of the analog data from the instruments is performed by the custom SIDECAR ASIC (System for Image Digitization, Enhancement, Control And Retrieval Application Specific Integrated Circuit ). NASA stated that the SIDECAR ASIC will include all the functions of a 9.1 kg (20 lb) instrument box in a 3 cm (1.2 in) package and consume only 11 milliwatts of power. [ 178 ] Since this conversion must be done close to the detectors, on the cold side of the telescope, the low power dissipation is crucial for maintaining the low temperature required for optimal operation of Webb. [ 178 ] The telescope is equipped with a solid-state drive (SSD) with a capacity of 68 GB, used as temporary storage for data collected from its scientific instruments. By the end of the 10-year mission, the usable capacity of the drive is expected to decrease to 60 GB due to radiation and read/write operations. [ 179 ] Micrometeoroid strikes [ edit ] The C3 [ c ] mirror segment suffered a micrometeoroid strike from a large dust mote-sized particle between 23 and 25 May 2022, the fifth and largest strike since launch, reported 8 June 2022, which required engineers to compensate for the strike using a mirror actuator. [ 181 ] Despite the strike, a NASA characterization report states "all JWST observing modes have been reviewed and confirmed to be ready for science use" as of 10 July 2022. [ 182 ] Micrometeoroids strike Webb an average of once or twice per month, and only the May 2022 strike caused noticeable damage. [ 183 ] After that strike, mission personnel implemented a strategy to change Webb's observations to reduce the risk of further damage. The strategy is to avoid pointing the mirror toward "micrometeoroid avoidance zones" at particular points along Webb's orbit. [ 184 ] Launch and commissioning [ edit ] Main article: Launch and commissioning of the James Webb Space Telescope Launch [ edit ] Main article: Ariane flight VA256 The launch (designated Ariane flight VA256 ) took place as scheduled at 12:20 UTC on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket that lifted off from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana . [ 185 ] [ 186 ] The telescope was confirmed to be receiving power, starting a two-week deployment phase of its parts [ 187 ] and traveling to its target destination. [ 188 ] [ 189 ] [ 190 ] The telescope was released from the upper stage 27 minutes 7 seconds after launch, beginning a 30-day adjustment to place the telescope in a Lissajous orbit [ 191 ] around the L 2 Lagrange point . The telescope was launched with slightly less speed than needed to reach its final orbit, and slowed as it travelled away from Earth, so it reached L 2 with only the velocity needed to enter its orbit there. The telescope reached L 2 on 24 January 2022. The flight included three planned course corrections to adjust its speed and direction. This is because the observatory could recover from underthrust (going too slowly), but could not recover from overthrust (going too fast)– to protect highly temperature-sensitive instruments, the sunshield must remain between the telescope and the Sun, so the spacecraft could not turn around or use its thrusters to slow down. [ 192 ] An L 2 orbit is unstable , so JWST needs to use propellant to maintain its halo orbit around L 2 (known as station-keeping ) to prevent the telescope from drifting away from its orbital position. [ 193 ] It was designed to carry enough propellant for 10 years, [ 194 ] but the precision of the Ariane 5 launch and the first midcourse correction were credited with saving enough onboard fuel that JWST may be able to maintain its orbit for around 20 years instead. [ 195 ] [ 196 ] [ 197 ] Space.com called the launch "flawless". [ 198 ] Diagram of Webb inside Ariane 5 Ariane 5 and Webb at the ELA-3 launch pad Ariane 5 containing the James Webb Space Telescope lifting off from the launch pad Ariane 5 containing Webb moments after lift-off Webb as seen from the ESC-D Cryotechnic upper stage shortly after separation, approximately 29 minutes after launch. Part of the Earth with the Gulf of Aden is visible in the background of the image. [ 199 ] Transit and structural deployment [ edit ] Structural deployment timeline [ 51 ] Webb was released from the rocket upper stage 27 minutes after a flawless launch. [ 185 ] [ 198 ] Starting 31 minutes after launch, and continuing for about 13 days, Webb began the process of deploying its solar array, antenna, sunshield, and mirrors. [ 200 ] Nearly all deployment actions are commanded by the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , Maryland, except for two early automatic steps, solar panel unfolding and communication antenna deployment. [ 201 ] [ 202 ] The mission was designed to give ground controllers flexibility to change or modify the deployment sequence in case of problems. [ 203 ] Structural deployment sequence At 7:50 p.m. EST on 25 December 2021, about 12 hours after launch, the telescope's pair of primary rockets began firing for 65 minutes to make the first of three planned mid-course corrections. [ 204 ] On day two, the high-gain communication antenna deployed automatically. [ 203 ] On 27 December 2021, at 60 hours after launch, Webb's rockets fired for nine minutes and 27 seconds to make the second of three mid-course corrections for the telescope to arrive at its L 2 destination. [ 205 ] On 28 December 2021, three days after launch, mission controllers began the multi-day deployment of Webb's all-important sunshield. On 30 December 2021, controllers completed two more steps in the observatory's unpacking. First, commands deployed the aft "momentum flap", a device that provides balance against solar pressure on the sunshield, saving fuel by reducing the need for thruster firing to maintain Webb's orientation. [ 206 ] On 31 December 2021, the ground team extended the two telescoping "mid booms" from the left and right sides of the observatory. [ 207 ] The left side deployed in 3 hours and 19 minutes; the right side took 3 hours and 42 minutes. [ 208 ] [ 207 ] Commands to separate and tension the membranes followed between 3 and 4 January and were successful. [ 207 ] On 5 January 2022, mission control successfully deployed the telescope's secondary mirror, which locked itself into place to a tolerance of about one and a half millimeters. [ 209 ] The final step in structural deployment was to unfold the primary mirror's wings. Each panel consists of three primary mirror segments and must be folded to allow the space telescope to be installed in the fairing of the Ariane rocket for launch. On 7 January 2022, NASA deployed and locked in place the port-side wing, [ 210 ] and on 8 January, the starboard-side mirror wing. This completed the structural deployment of the observatory. [ 211 ] [ 212 ] [ 213 ] On 24 January 2022, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, [ 214 ] nearly a month after launch, a third and final course correction took place, inserting Webb into its planned halo orbit around the Sun–Earth L 2 point. [ 215 ] [ 216 ] The MIRI instrument has four observing modes– imaging, low-resolution spectroscopy, medium-resolution spectroscopy, and coronagraphic imaging. "On Aug. 24, a mechanism that supports medium-resolution spectroscopy (MRS) exhibited what appears to be increased friction during setup for a science observation. This mechanism is a grating wheel that allows scientists to select between short, medium, and longer wavelengths when making observations using the MRS mode", said NASA in a press statement. [ 217 ] Animation of Webb's halo orbit Commissioning and testing [ edit ] On 12 January 2022, while still in transit, mirror alignment began. The primary mirror segments and the secondary mirror were moved away from their protective launch positions. This took about 10 days, because the 132 [ 218 ] actuator motors are designed to fine-tune the mirror positions at microscopic accuracy (10 nanometer increments) and must each move over 1.2 million increments (12.5 mm) during initial alignment. [ 219 ] [ 41 ] Mirror alignment requires each of the 18 mirror segments and the secondary mirror to be positioned to within 50 nanometers. NASA compares the accuracy needed by analogy: "If the Webb primary mirror were the size of the United States, each [mirror] segment would be the size of Texas, and the team would need to line the height of those Texas-sized segments up with each other to an accuracy of about 1.5 inches". [ 220 ] James Webb Space Telescope Mirror alignment animations Segment image identification. 18 mirror segments are moved to determine which segment creates which segment image. After matching the mirror segments to their respective photos, the mirrors are tilted to align all images around a common point for further analysis. Segment alignment begins by defocusing the segment images by moving the secondary mirror slightly. Mathematical analysis, known as phase retrieval, is applied to defocused photos to determine the precise positioning errors of the segments. Adjusting the segments then yields 18 well-corrected "telescopes". However, the segments still do not work together as a single mirror. Image stacking. To put all the light in a single place, each segment image must be stacked on top of the others. In the image-stacking step, the individual segment images are shifted so they fall precisely at the center of the field, producing a single unified image. This process prepares the telescope for coarse phasing. Telescope alignment over instrument fields of view. After fine phasing, the telescope is well aligned at a single location in the NIRCam field of view. Next, the alignment must be extended to the remaining instruments. Mirror alignment was a complex operation split into seven phases, repeatedly rehearsed using a 1:6-scale model of the telescope. [ 220 ] Once the mirrors reached 120 K (−153 °C; −244 °F), [ 221 ] NIRCam targeted the 7th-magnitude star HD 84406 in Ursa Major . [ d ] [ 223 ] [ 224 ] To do this, NIRCam took 1560 images of the sky and used these wide-ranging images to determine where in the sky each segment of the main mirror initially pointed. [ 225 ] At first, the individual primary mirror segments were greatly misaligned, so the image contained 18 separate, blurry images of the star field, each containing an image of the target star. The 18 images of HD 84406 are matched to their respective mirror segments, and the 18 segments are brought into approximate alignment centered on the star ("Segment Image Identification"). Each segment was then corrected for its major focusing errors using a technique called phase retrieval , yielding 18 high-quality images from the 18 mirror segments ("Segment Alignment"). The 18 images from each segment were then moved so they precisely overlap to create a single image ("Image Stacking"). [ 220 ] With the mirrors positioned to produce almost correct images, they had to be fine-tuned to an operational accuracy of 50 nanometers, less than one wavelength of the light that will be detected. A technique called dispersed fringe sensing was used to compare images from 20 pairings of mirrors, allowing most of the errors to be corrected ("Coarse Phasing"), and then introduced light defocus to each segment's image, allowing detection and correction of almost all remaining errors ("Fine Phasing"). These two processes were repeated three times, and Fine Phasing will be routinely checked throughout the telescope's operation. After three rounds of Coarse and Fine Phasing, the telescope was well aligned at a single location in the NIRCam field of view. Measurements will be made at various points in the captured image across all instruments, and corrections will be calculated from the detected intensity variations, yielding a well-aligned outcome across all instruments ("Telescope Alignment Over Instrument Fields of View"). Finally, a final round of Fine Phasing and image-quality checks on all instruments was performed to ensure that any remaining small residual errors from the previous steps were corrected ("Iterate Alignment for Final Correction"). The telescope's mirror segments were then aligned, allowing it to capture precise, focused images. [ 220 ] In preparation for alignment, NASA announced at 19:28 UTC on 3 February 2022, that NIRCam had detected the telescope's first photons (although not yet complete images). [ 220 ] [ 226 ] On 11 February 2022, NASA announced the telescope had almost completed phase 1 of alignment, with every segment of its primary mirror having located and imaged the target star HD 84406, and all segments brought into approximate alignment. [ 225 ] Phase 1 alignment was completed on 18 February 2022, [ 227 ] and a week later, phases 2 and 3 were also completed. [ 228 ] This meant the 18 segments were working in unison, however until all 7 phases are complete, the segments were still acting as 18 smaller telescopes rather than one larger one. [ 228 ] At the same time as the primary mirror was being commissioned, hundreds of other instrument commissioning and calibration tasks were also ongoing.

[ 235 ] The GTO program provides guaranteed observing time for scientists who developed hardware and software components for the observatory. The GO program provides all astronomers the opportunity to apply for observing time and will represent the bulk of the observing time. GO programs are selected through peer review by a Time Allocation Committee (TAC), similar to the proposal review process used for the Hubble Space Telescope. The DDT program is used for time-critical observations. Early Release Science program [ edit ] In November 2017, the Space Telescope Science Institute announced the selection of 13 Director's Discretionary Early Release Science (DD-ERS) programs, chosen through a competitive proposal process. [ 236 ] [ 237 ] The observations for these programs – Early Release Observations (ERO) [ 238 ] [ 239 ] – were to be obtained during the first five months of Webb science operations after the end of the commissioning period. A total of 460 hours of observing time was awarded to these 13 programs, which span science topics including the Solar System , exoplanets , stars and star formation , nearby and distant galaxies , gravitational lenses , and quasars . These 13 ERS programs were to use a total of 242.8 hours of telescope observing time (excluding Webb overheads and slew time).

[ 254 ] The Cycle 2 GO program was announced on 10 May 2023. [ 255 ] Webb science observations are nominally scheduled in weekly increments. The observation plan for every week is published on Mondays by the Space Telescope Science Institute. [ 256 ] In Cycle 4 the telescope showed its continued popularity in the astronomy community by garnering 2,377 proposals for 78,000 hours of observing time, nine times more than the available amount. [ 257 ] Scientific results [ edit ] The JWST completed its commissioning and began full scientific operations on 11 July 2022. [ 258 ] With some exceptions, most experiment data is kept private for one year for the exclusive use of scientists running that particular experiment, and then the raw data is released to the public.

First full-color images [ edit ] The first full-color images and spectroscopic data were released on 12 July 2022, marking the official start of Webb's general science operations. U.S. President Joe Biden revealed the first image, Webb's First Deep Field , on 11 July 2022. [ 262 ] [ 263 ] Additional releases around this time include: [ 267 ] [ 268 ] [ 269 ] Carina Nebula – young, star-forming region called NGC 3324 about 8,500 light-years from Earth, described by NASA as "Cosmic Cliffs". WASP-96b – including an analysis of atmosphere with evidence of water around a giant gas planet orbiting a distant star 1,120 light-years from Earth. Southern Ring Nebula – clouds of gas and dust expelled by a dying star 2,500 light-years from Earth. Stephan's Quintet – a visual display of five galaxies with colliding gas and dust clouds creating new stars; four central galaxies are 290 million light-years from Earth. SMACS J0723.3-7327 – a galaxy cluster at redshift 0.39, with distant background galaxies whose images are distorted and magnified due to gravitational lensing by the cluster. This image has been called Webb's First Deep Field . It was later discovered that in this picture were three ancient galaxies that existed shortly after the Big Bang. The images of these distant galaxies are views of the universe 13.1 billion years ago. [ 268 ] [ 270 ] [ 271 ] On 14 July 2022, NASA presented images of Jupiter and related areas by the JWST, including infrared views. [ 272 ] In a preprint released around the same time, NASA, ESA, and CSA scientists stated that "the science performance of JWST is better than expected". The document stated that during commissioning, the instruments captured spectra of transiting exoplanets with a precision better than 1000 ppm per data point and tracked moving objects at speeds up to 67 milliarcseconds/second, more than twice the required speed. [ a ] It also obtained the spectra of hundreds of stars simultaneously in a dense field towards the Milky Way 's Galactic Center .

MIRI low-resolution spectroscopy (LRS): a hot super-Earth planet L 168-9 b (TOI-134) around a bright M-dwarf star ( red dwarf star) [ 273 ] Bright early galaxies [ edit ] Within two weeks of the first Webb images, several preprint papers described a wide range of high-redshift, very luminous (presumably large) galaxies believed to date back to 235 million years (z=16.7) to 280 million years after the Big Bang, far earlier than previously known. [ 238 ] [ 239 ] On 17 August 2022, NASA released a large mosaic image of 690 individual frames taken by the NIRCam on Webb of numerous very early galaxies. [ 274 ] [ 275 ] Some early galaxies observed by Webb like CEERS-93316 , which was believed to have an estimated photometric redshift of approximately z=16.7 corresponding to 235.8 million years after the Big Bang, are high redshift galaxy candidates. [ 276 ] [ 277 ] However, for CEERS-93316 specifically, a later spectroscopic redshift measurement revealed a more accurate redshift value of approximately z=4.91. [ 278 ] In September 2022, primordial black holes were proposed as explaining these unexpectedly large and early galaxies. [ 279 ] [ 280 ] [ 281 ] In May 2024, the JWST identified the most distant known galaxy, JADES-GS-z14-0 , [ 282 ] seen just 290 million years after the Big Bang, corresponding to a redshift of 14.32. Part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), this discovery highlights a galaxy significantly more luminous and massive than expected for such an early period. Detailed analysis using JWST's NIRSpec and MIRI instruments revealed this galaxy's remarkable properties, including its significant size and dust content, challenging current models of early galaxy formation. [ 282 ] November 2025 JWST observations confirmed an actively growing supermassive black hole within a " little red dot " galaxy named CANUCS-LRD-z8.6. [ 283 ] In late 2025, JWST observations of high-redshift " little red dots " (LRDs) and early galaxies provided constraints favoring the existence of massive black hole seeds over standard stellar-remnant models. In August 2025, Juodžbalis et al. reported a direct dynamical mass measurement of a black hole in a strongly lensed LRD galaxy UHZ1 at redshift z=7.04, finding a central mass of about 50 million solar masses, outweighing its galaxy's stars. The authors describe it as consistent with formation in the early universe. [ 284 ] Subsequently, Tripodi et al. identified an active galactic nucleus in the LRD "CANUCS-LRD-z8.6" at about z=8.6, containing a roughly 10 8 solar mass black hole that had grown rapidly before its host galaxy established significant stellar mass, consistent with extremely early formation or direct collapse . [ 285 ] Concurrently, Chavez Ortiz et al. presented evidence for an active ~10 7.2 solar mass black hole in the galaxy GHZ2 at z=12.34, less than 400 million years after the Big Bang — the most distant black hole identified to date — further challenging standard accretion limits and supporting rapid formation mechanisms.

[ 25 ] During commissioning, various asteroids were observed to determine the actual limitation for the speed of objects and it turned out to be 67 mas/s, which is more than twice the nominal value. Tracking at rates of 30–67 mas/s showed accuracies similar to tracking of slower targets. Thus, the telescope can observe also near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), comets closer to perihelion and interstellar objects . [ 26 ] : 8 Later, after more experience with FGS had been gained, the tracking speed limit was finally set to 75 mas/s for routine observations. Higher rates up to 100 mas/s are also possible upon special request, as FGS requires multiple guide stars to achieve this, which introduces complexity and inefficiency. The first observation with a super-fast rate was the DART impact experiment on 26 September 2022. [ 27 ] ^ "Baffled", in this context, means enclosed in a tube in a similar manner to a conventional optical telescope , which helps to stop stray light entering the telescope from the side.

Its visual apparent magnitude m v is 10.95, which makes it much too faint to be observed with the naked eye. It is cooler than the Sun , but some 13 to 16 times brighter in visible light, [ 230 ] and is consequently not a sun-like star .

The program intends to reestablish a human presence on the Moon for the first time since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, with a stated long-term goal of establishing a permanent base on the Moon , which is expected to facilitate human missions to Mars . Two principal elements of the Artemis program are derived from the now-cancelled Constellation program : the Orion spacecraft (with the ESM instead of a US-built service module) and the Space Launch System 's (SLS) solid rocket boosters (originally developed for the Ares V ). Other elements of the program, such as the Lunar Gateway space station and the Human Landing System , are in development by government space agencies and private spaceflight companies, collaborations bound by the Artemis Accords and governmental contracts. Orion [ edit ] The Artemis program is organized around a series of SLS missions. These space missions will increase in complexity and are scheduled to occur at intervals of a year or more. NASA and its partners have planned Artemis I through Artemis V missions; later Artemis missions have also been proposed. Each SLS mission centers on the launch of an SLS launch vehicle carrying an Orion spacecraft . Missions after Artemis II will depend on support missions launched by other organizations and spacecraft for support functions. The Space Launch System, Orion spacecraft and the Human Landing System form the main spaceflight infrastructure for Artemis, and the Lunar Gateway plays a supporting role in human habitation. Supporting infrastructures for Artemis include the Commercial Lunar Payload Services , development of ground infrastructures , Artemis Base Camp on the Moon, Moon rovers, and spacesuits. Some aspects of the program have been criticized, such as the use of a near-rectilinear halo orbit and the program's sustainability. Orion's first launch on the Space Launch System was originally set in 2016, but faced numerous delays; it launched on November 16, 2022, as the Artemis I mission, with robots and mannequins aboard. As of November 2025 [update] , the crewed Artemis II launch is scheduled for March 2026, the Artemis III crewed lunar landing is expected to launch no earlier than mid-2027, the Artemis IV docking (with the Lunar Gateway) is planned for late 2028, the Artemis V docking (with the European Space Agency's ESPRIT , Canada's Canadarm3 , and NASA's Lunar Terrain Vehicle ) is planned for early 2030, and the Artemis VI docking (which is expected to integrate the Crew and Science Airlock with the Lunar Gateway station ) is planned for early 2031. After Artemis VI, NASA plans yearly landings on the Moon from then on. The program faced its greatest threat due to the economics of launch changing drastically in the early 2020s because of reusable launch vehicles . After multiple sessions of Congress debated the viability of the program, it was ultimately funded by the passage of the 2025 One Big Beautiful Bill Act . [ 9 ] SLS missions [ edit ] Artemis I (November 16, 2022 - 01:47:44 EST ) was the successful uncrewed test of the SLS and Orion, and was the first test flight for both craft. [ i ] The Artemis I mission placed Orion into a lunar orbit and then returned to Earth. The SLS Block 1 design uses the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) second stage, which performs the trans-lunar injection burn to send Orion to lunar space. For Artemis I, Orion braked into a polar distant retrograde lunar orbit and remained for about six days before boosting back toward Earth. The Orion capsule separated from its service module, re-entered the atmosphere for aerobraking , and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean under parachutes. [ 10 ] Artemis II (April 2026) is planned to be the first crewed test flight of SLS and the Orion spacecraft. [ 11 ] The four crew members will perform extensive testing in Earth orbit, and Orion will then be boosted into a free-return trajectory around the Moon , which will return Orion to Earth for re-entry and splashdown. Launch is scheduled for no earlier than April 1, 2026. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Artemis III (2027–2028) is planned to be the first American crewed lunar landing since Apollo 17 in December 1972. [ 11 ] The mission depends on a support mission to place a Starship Human Landing System (HLS) in a near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) of the Moon prior to the launch of SLS/Orion. After Starship HLS reaches NRHO, SLS/Orion will send the Orion spacecraft with a crew of four to dock with HLS. [ ii ] Two astronauts will transfer to HLS, which will descend to the lunar surface and spend about 6.5 days on the surface. [ 14 ] The astronauts will perform at least two extravehicular activities (EVAs) on the surface before the HLS ascends to return them to a rendezvous with Orion. Orion will return the four astronauts to Earth. Launch is scheduled for no earlier than mid-2027. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Planned missions of Artemis program Artemis IV (2028–2029) is planned to be the second crewed lunar landing mission. Artemis V (2030–2031) is planned to be the third crewed lunar landing, which will deliver four astronauts to the Lunar Gateway station . Artemis VI (2032) is planned to be the fourth crewed lunar landing, which will integrate the Crew and Science Airlock Module with the Gateway space station. [ 15 ] Launch is scheduled for no earlier than March 2031. [ 16 ] As of 2024, the Airlock module is under construction. [ 17 ] Artemis VII (2033) is planned to be the fifth crewed lunar landing, which will deliver the Habitable Mobility Platform ( Lunar Cruiser ) to the surface of the Moon on an SLS Block 1B rocket. Launch is scheduled for no earlier than March 2032. [ 18 ] Artemis VIII (2034) is planned to be the sixth crewed lunar landing, which will have a lunar landing with the delivery of lunar surface logistics and the Foundational Surface Habitat using an SLS Block 1B rocket with the aid of Blue Origin. Launch is scheduled for no earlier than 2033. [ 19 ] Artemis IX (2035) is planned to be the seventh crewed lunar landing, which will have another lunar landing with the delivery of additional lunar surface logistics. Unlike Artemis VIII, however, this mission will be the first to use an SLS Block 2 rocket. [ 20 ] Artemis X (2036) is planned to be the eighth crewed lunar landing, which will feature the delivery of additional lunar surface logistics using an SLS Block 2 rocket, and will also include astronauts staying on the Moon for an extended period of time. [ 20 ] Planning is ongoing for Artemis IV and V. For the first, Orion and an upgraded Starship HLS will dock with the Lunar Gateway station in NRHO prior to the landing. The extra power of this mission's SLS Block 1B will allow it to deliver the I-HAB Gateway module for connection to the Lunar Gateway. Launch is scheduled for no earlier than September 2028. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] The mission will deliver the European Space Agency 's ESPRIT refueling and communications module and Canadarm3 , a Canadian-built robotic arm system for the Gateway. Also delivered will be NASA's Lunar Terrain Vehicle . Launch is scheduled for no earlier than March 2030. [ 21 ] [ 16 ] The mission will also be the first to use Blue Origin 's Blue Moon lander to take astronauts to the Moon's surface. For many Artemis program missions, the Space Launch System's two solid rocket boosters' engines and casings and four main engines and the Orion spacecraft's main engine will all be previously flown Space Shuttle main engines , solid rocket boosters , and Orbital Maneuvering System engines. They are refurbished legacy engines from the Space Shuttle program, some of which even date back to the early 1980s. For example, Artemis I had components that flew on 83 of the 135 Space Shuttle missions. From Artemis I to Artemis IV recycled Shuttle main engines will be used before manufacturing new engines. From Artemis I to Artemis III recycled Shuttle solid rocket boosters' engines and steel casings will be used before manufacturing new ones. From Artemis I to Artemis VI the Orion main engine will use six previously flown Space Shuttle OMS engines. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Support missions [ edit ] Support missions include robotic landers, delivery of Gateway modules, Gateway logistics, delivery of the HLS, and delivery of elements of the Moon base . Most of these missions are executed under NASA contracts to commercial providers. Under the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, several robotic landers will deliver scientific instruments and robotic rovers to the lunar surface after Artemis I. Additional CLPS missions are planned throughout the Artemis program to deliver payloads to the Moon base. These include habitat modules and rovers in support of crewed missions. A Human Landing System (HLS) is a spacecraft that can convey crew members from NRHO to the lunar surface, support them on the surface, and return them to NRHO. Each crewed landing needs one HLS, although some or all of the spacecraft may be reusable. Each HLS must be launched from Earth and delivered to NRHO in one or more launches. The initial commercial contract was awarded to SpaceX for two Starship HLS missions, one uncrewed and one crewed as part of Artemis III. These two missions each require one HLS launch and multiple fueling launches, all on SpaceX Starship launchers. NASA later exercised an option under the initial contract to commission an upgraded Starship HLS for Artemis IV and a separate contract to Blue Origin to develop a third crewed lunar lander, which will make its first crewed flight as part of the Artemis V mission. The first two Gateway modules (PPE and HALO) will be delivered to NRHO in a single launch using a Falcon Heavy launcher. Originally planned to be available prior to Artemis III, as of 2021, it is planned for availability before Artemis IV. The Gateway will be resupplied and supported by launches of Dragon XL spacecraft launched by Falcon Heavy. Each Dragon XL will remain attached to Gateway for up to six months. The Dragon XLs will not return to Earth, but will be disposed of, probably by deliberate crashes on the lunar surface. History [ edit ] Further information: Human Landing System An artist's rendering of the lunar module (left) and space capsule of the Constellation program Early history [ edit ] The Artemis program incorporates several major components of previously cancelled NASA programs and missions, including the Constellation program and the Asteroid Redirect Mission . Originally legislated by the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 , Constellation included the development of Ares I , Ares V , and the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle. The program ran from the early 2000s until 2010. [ 26 ] In May 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama established the Augustine Committee to take into account several objectives including support for the International Space Station , development of missions beyond low Earth orbit (including the Moon, Mars, and near-Earth objects ), and use of the commercial space industry within defined budget limits. [ 27 ] The committee concluded that the Constellation program was massively underfunded and that a 2020 Moon landing was impossible. Constellation was subsequently put on hold. [ 28 ] On April 15, 2010, President Obama spoke at the Kennedy Space Center , announcing the administration's plans for NASA and cancelling the non-Orion elements of Constellation on the premise that the program had become nonviable. [ 29 ] He instead proposed US$6 billion in additional funding and called for the development of a new heavy-lift rocket program to be ready for construction by 2015 with crewed missions to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s. [ 30 ] On October 11, 2010, President Obama signed into law the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 , which included requirements for the immediate development of the Space Launch System as a follow-on launch vehicle to the Space Shuttle , and continued development of a Crew Exploration Vehicle to be capable of supporting missions beyond low Earth orbit starting in 2016, while making use of the workforce, assets, and capabilities of the Space Shuttle program , Constellation program, and other NASA programs. The law also invested in space technologies and robotics capabilities tied to the overall space exploration framework, ensured continued support for Commercial Orbital Transportation Services , Commercial Resupply Services , and expanded the Commercial Crew Development program. [ 31 ] On June 30, 2017, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to re-establish the National Space Council , chaired by Vice President Mike Pence . The Trump administration's first budget request kept Obama-era human spaceflight programs in place: Commercial Resupply Services, Commercial Crew Development, the Space Launch System, and the Orion spacecraft for deep space missions, while reducing Earth science research and calling for the elimination of NASA's education office. [ 32 ] Redefinition and naming as Artemis [ edit ] On December 11, 2017, President Trump signed Space Policy Directive 1 , a change in national space policy that provides for a U.S.-led, integrated program with private sector partners for a human return to the Moon, followed by missions to Mars and beyond. The policy calls for the NASA administrator to "lead an innovative and sustainable program of exploration with commercial and international partners to enable human expansion across the Solar System and to bring back to Earth new knowledge and opportunities". The effort intends to more effectively organize government, private industry, and international efforts toward returning humans to the Moon and laying the foundation of eventual human exploration of Mars . [ 2 ] Space Policy Directive 1 authorized the lunar-focused campaign. The campaign, later named Artemis, draws upon legacy US spacecraft programs, including the Orion space capsule, the Lunar Gateway space station, and Commercial Lunar Payload Services , and creates entirely new programs such as the Human Landing System. The in-development Space Launch System is expected to serve as the primary launch vehicle for Orion, while commercial launch vehicles will launch various other elements of the program. [ 33 ] The Orion capsule in the Pacific Ocean , following the Exploration Flight Test-1 mission On March 26, 2019, Vice President Mike Pence announced that NASA's Moon landing goal would be accelerated by four years with a planned landing in 2024. [ 34 ] On May 16, 2019, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine announced that the new program would be named Artemis , after the goddess of the Moon in Greek mythology who is the twin sister of Apollo . [ 33 ] [ 35 ] Despite the immediate new goals, Mars missions by the 2030s were still intended as of May 2019 [update] . [ 2 ] In mid-2019, NASA requested US$1.6 billion in additional funding for Artemis for fiscal year 2020, [ 36 ] while the Senate Appropriations Committee requested from NASA a five-year budget profile [ 37 ] which is needed for evaluation and approval by Congress . [ 38 ] [ 39 ] In February 2020, the White House requested a funding increase of 12% to cover the Artemis program as part of its fiscal year 2021 budget . The total budget would have been US$25.2 billion per year with US$3.7 billion dedicated toward a Human Landing System. NASA Chief Financial Officer Jeff DeWit said he thought the agency had "a very good shot" to get this budget through Congress despite Democratic concerns around the program. [ 40 ] However, in July 2020, the House Appropriations Committee rejected the White House's requested funding increase. [ 41 ] The bill proposed in the House dedicated only US$700 million toward the Human Landing System, 81% (US$3 billion) short of the requested amount. [ 42 ] In April 2020, NASA awarded funding to Blue Origin, Dynetics, and SpaceX for 10-month-long preliminary design studies for the HLS. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Throughout February 2021, Acting Administrator of NASA Steve Jurczyk reiterated those budget concerns when asked about the project's schedule, [ 46 ] [ 47 ] clarifying that "The 2024 lunar landing goal may no longer be a realistic target [...]". [ 48 ] On February 4, 2021, the Biden administration endorsed the Artemis program. [ 49 ] More specifically, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki expressed the Biden administration's "support [for] this effort and endeavor". [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] On April 16, 2021, NASA contracted SpaceX to develop, manufacture, and fly two lunar landing flights with the Starship HLS lunar lander. [ 53 ] Blue Origin and Dynetics protested the award to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on April 26. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] After the GAO rejected the protests, [ 56 ] Blue Origin sued NASA over the award, [ 57 ] [ 58 ] and NASA agreed to stop work on the contract until November 1 as the lawsuit proceeded. The judge dismissed the suit on November 4, and NASA resumed work with SpaceX. [ 59 ] On September 25, 2021, NASA released its first digital, interactive graphic novel in celebration of National Comic Book Day. "First Woman: NASA's Promise for Humanity" is the fictional story of Callie Rodriguez, the first woman to explore the Moon. [ 60 ] In March 2025, with the diversity, equity, and inclusion policies of the second Trump administration , this was removed from NASA's web pages, [ 61 ] together with other information about the graphic novel. [ clarification needed ] On November 15, 2021, an audit of NASA's Office of Inspector General estimated the true cost of the Artemis program at about $93 billion until 2025. [ 1 ] In addition to the initial SpaceX contract, NASA awarded two rounds of separate contracts in May 2019 [ 62 ] and September 2021, [ 63 ] on aspects of the HLS to encourage alternative designs, separately from the initial HLS development effort. It announced in March 2022 that it was developing new sustainability rules and pursuing both a Starship HLS upgrade (an option under the initial SpaceX contract) and new competing alternative designs. These came after criticism from members of Congress over the lack of redundancy and competition, and led NASA to ask for additional support. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Artemis I (2022) [ edit ] Further information: Artemis I Artemis I successfully launched from the Kennedy Space Center on November 16, 2022. Orion shortly after splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on December 11, 2022. Artemis I was originally scheduled for late 2016, and as delays accrued, eventually for late 2021, but the launch date was then pushed back to August 29, 2022. [ 66 ] Various delays related to final infrastructure repairs and weather pushed the launch date further out. [ 67 ] In October 2022, NASA launch managers decided on a new launch date in November, which was again slightly delayed due to preparation and weather. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 4 ] On November 16 at 01:47:44 EST (06:47:44 UTC ), Artemis I successfully launched from the Kennedy Space Center . [ 70 ] Artemis I was completed at 09:40 PST (17:40 UTC) on December 11, when the Orion spacecraft splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, west of Baja California, after a record-breaking mission, which saw Artemis travel more than 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) on a path around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. The splashdown occurred 50 years to the day since NASA's Apollo 17 Moon landing, the last human crewed mission to touch down on the lunar surface. [ 71 ] Artemis II (2026) [ edit ] Main article: Artemis II Artemis II at Launch Complex 39B in January 2026 The Artemis II mission is to be the second flight of the SLS, and the first crewed mission of the Orion spacecraft. It is the first crewed mission around the Moon, and beyond low Earth orbit, since Apollo 17 in 1972. The mission will launch no earlier than April 1, 2026. [ 13 ] Glover (left), Koch (center), and Hansen (right) are planned to be the first person of color, woman, and non-US citizen to go beyond low Earth orbit, respectively. Position Astronaut Commander Reid Wiseman , NASA Second spaceflight Pilot Victor Glover , NASA Second spaceflight Payload Specialist Christina Koch , NASA Second spaceflight Mission Specialist Jeremy Hansen , CSA First spaceflight Artemis II is to be crewed by four astronauts: commander Reid Wiseman , pilot Victor J. Glover , payload specialist Christina Koch , and mission specialist Jeremy Hansen . [ 72 ] Jenni Gibbons is Hansen's backup; she will join the mission if Hansen is unable to. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] Glover, Koch, and Hansen are planned to be the first person of color , woman, and non-US citizen to go beyond low Earth orbit , respectively. [ 72 ] Hansen and Gibbons are Canadian and have been assigned by the Canadian Space Agency ; [ 72 ] a 2020 treaty between the United States and Canada led to their involvement. [ 75 ] Artemis III (2027) [ edit ] Further information: Artemis III Milestones Toward Launch [ edit ] Artemis III is expected to launch no earlier than mid-2027 as the first crewed landing on the Moon since Apollo 17. In February 2024, NASA completed full qualification testing of the docking systems on Starship HLS . [ 76 ] Also in February, the bulk of the manufacturing for the core stage of the SLS to be used in the mission was completed. [ 77 ] In April 2024, NASA completed Starship’s first internal propellant transfer demonstration. The Starship’s tanker variant ability to act as an orbital propellant depot to Starship HLS is a key capability necessary to complete the Artemis III mission. A ship-to-ship propellant transfer demonstration to further prove out the capability is expected in 2025. [ 78 ] The European Service Module for the mission was reported on track to be handed over to NASA in summer 2024. [ 79 ] The first integrated test for the mission, which included the next generation space suits developed by Axiom Space, and the airlock module of Starship HLS was conducted in June 2024. [ 80 ] On December 5, 2024, NASA delayed the Artemis III mission from September 2026 to mid-2027, citing damage found to the heat shield of the uncrewed Orion capsule that flew on the Artemis I mission in 2022. [ 81 ] Instruments and payloads [ edit ] In March 2024, NASA announced the scientific instruments to be included on the mission were a compact, autonomous seismometer suite called the Lunar Environment Monitoring Station, or LEMS. LEMS will characterize the regional structure of the Moon's crust and mantle, to inform the development of lunar formation and evolution models. Another instrument is the Lunar Effects on Agricultural Flora, a.k.a. LEAF, which will investigate the impact of the lunar surface environment on space crops. The third instrument is the Lunar Dielectric Analyzer, or LDA, an internationally contributed payload that will measure the regolith 's ability to propagate an electric field. [ 82 ] Artemis IV (2028) [ edit ] Further information: Artemis IV Artemis IV is expected to launch no earlier than September 2028. Prior to the launch of the mission, a Falcon Heavy is planned to launch the first two Lunar Gateway elements: the Power and Propulsion Element and Habitation and Logistics Outpost , now scheduled for 2027 . Artemis IV will then be responsible for launching with a crew with the International Habitation Module (I-Hab) and adding the module to the Gateway space station. SLS Block 1B manufacture began in March 2024. [ 83 ] The I-Hab module construction was underway as of April 2024. [ 84 ] In May 2024, it was reported NASA made significant progress towards completion of Mobile Launcher 2 (ML-2), the launch platform that will be used by the larger SLS Block 1B. [ 85 ] In August 2024, the NASA Inspector General estimated that the launch platform could end up costing the agency $2.5 billion, more than six times its original value and may not be ready to support a launch until 2029, making the current launch schedule unrealistic. [ 86 ] NASA has highlighted three initial goals for the mission: launch with a crewed Orion spacecraft and Lunar I-Hab Gateway element for payload delivery on SLS an Block 1B rocket to lunar orbit; delivery of Lunar I-Hab to Gateway, where it will dock to HALO; human landing system spacecraft docking. Two key objectives are to follow on the surface: Artemis IV crew members will use the landing system to descend to and later ascend from the lunar surface before returning to Earth on Orion. [ 87 ] Artemis V (2030) [ edit ] Further information: Artemis V Artemis V is expected to launch no earlier than March 2030. The mission will launch four astronauts on a Space Launch System rocket and an Orion spacecraft to the Lunar Gateway . It will be the third lunar landing of the Artemis program. Artemis V will deliver two new elements to the Gateway space station. [ 88 ] After docking to the Gateway, two astronauts will board the Blue Moon lunar lander and fly it to the Lunar south pole to land near the Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV). This will be the first lunar landing since Apollo 17 to use an unpressurized lunar rover. [ 89 ] NASA has highlighted five key points for the mission, in chronological order: The crewed Orion spacecraft and the Lunar View element will launch as a co-manifested payload on an SLS Block 1B rocket to lunar orbit. Orion will deliver Lunar View to Gateway, where it will dock to HALO. A Human Landing System spacecraft will dock to Gateway. Artemis V crew members will use the Human Landing System to descend to and later ascend from the lunar surface. Artemis V crew will return to Earth on Orion. [ 87 ] Artemis VI (2031) [ edit ] Artemis VI is expected to launch no earlier than March 2031. [ 16 ] The primary objectives of this mission are to integrate the Crew and Science Airlock Module with Gateway, and to complete the fourth crewed lunar surface expedition of the Artemis missions. [ 87 ] As of 2024, the Airlock module is under construction by Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre . [ 17 ] NASA has highlighted five key points for the mission, in chronological order: The crewed Orion spacecraft and Gateway’s Crew and Science Airlock will launch as a co-manifested payload on an SLS Block 1B rocket to lunar orbit. Orion will deliver the Crew and Science Airlock to Gateway, where it will dock to Lunar I-Hab. A Human Landing System spacecraft will dock to Gateway. Artemis VI crew members will use the Human Landing System to descend to and later ascend from the lunar surface. Artemis VI crew will return to Earth on Orion. [ 87 ] Artemis VII (2032) [ edit ] Artemis VII is expected to launch no earlier than March 2032. The objectives are to deliver the Habitable Mobility Platform ( Lunar Cruiser ) to the surface of the moon on an SLS Block 1B rocket. The mission is expected to last around 30 days. [ 20 ] [ 19 ] Artemis VIII (2033) [ edit ] Artemis VIII is expected to launch no earlier than 2033. The mission will have a lunar landing, with the delivery of lunar surface logistics and the Foundational Surface Habitat, using an SLS Block 1B rocket with the aid of Blue Origin. The mission is expected to last around 60 days. [ 19 ] Artemis IX (2034) [ edit ] Artemis IX is expected to launch no earlier than 2034. The mission will have another lunar landing with the delivery of additional lunar surface logistics. This mission will be the first to use an SLS Block 2 rocket. The mission is expected to last around 60 days. [ 20 ] Artemis X (2035) [ edit ] Artemis X is planned to launch no earlier than 2035. This mission will feature the delivery of additional lunar surface logistics, and will include astronauts staying on the Moon long-term. The mission is expected to last up to 180 days. [ 20 ] Future [ edit ] As of 2026, additional missions beyond Artemis X have not officially been discussed. Additionally, the NASA Inspector General has stated in 2024 that the current launch timeline is "unrealistic" and will likely be further delayed. [ 20 ] Supporting programs [ edit ] Implementation of the Artemis program will require additional programs, projects, and commercial launchers to support the construction of the Lunar Gateway, launch resupply missions to the station, and deploy numerous robotic spacecraft and instruments to the lunar surface. [ 90 ] Several precursor robotic missions are being coordinated through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, which is dedicated to scouting and characterization of lunar resources as well as testing principles for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Commercial Lunar Payload Services [ edit ] Models of the first three commercial robotic landers selected for CLPS . From left: Peregrine by Astrobotic Technology , Nova-C by Intuitive Machines , and Z-01 by OrbitBeyond . Main article: Commercial Lunar Payload Services In March 2018, NASA established the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program with the aim of sending small robotic landers and rovers mostly to the lunar south pole region as a precursor to and in support of crewed missions. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] The main goals include scouting of lunar resources , ISRU feasibility testing, and lunar science. [ 94 ] NASA is awarding commercial providers indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts to develop and fly lunar landers with scientific payloads. [ 95 ] The first phase considered proposals capable of delivering at least 10 kg (22 lb) of payload by the end of 2021. [ 95 ] Proposals for mid-sized landers capable of delivering between 500 kg (1,100 lb) and 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) of cargo were planned to also be considered for launch beyond 2021. [ 96 ] In November 2018, NASA announced the first nine companies that were qualified to bid on the CLPS transportation service contracts (see list below). [ 97 ] On 31 May 2019, three of those were awarded lander contracts: Astrobotic Technology , Intuitive Machines , and OrbitBeyond . [ 98 ] On July 29, 2019, NASA announced that it had granted OrbitBeyond's request to be released from obligations under the contract citing "internal corporate challenges". [ 99 ] The first twelve payloads and experiments from NASA centers were announced on February 21, 2019. [ 100 ] On July 1, 2019, NASA announced the selection of twelve additional payloads, provided by universities and industry. Seven of these are scientific investigations while five are technology demonstrations. [ 101 ] The Lunar Surface Instrument and Technology Payloads (LSITP) program was soliciting payloads in 2019 that do not require significant additional development. They will include technology demonstrators to advance lunar science or the commercial development of the Moon. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] In November 2019, NASA added five contractors to the group of companies who are eligible to bid to send large payloads to the surface of the Moon under the CLPS program: Blue Origin , Ceres Robotics , Sierra Nevada Corporation , SpaceX , and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems . [ 104 ] [ 105 ] In April 2020, NASA selected Masten Space Systems for a follow-on CLPS delivery of cargo to the Moon in 2022. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] On June 23, 2021, Masten Space Systems announced it was delayed until November 2023. Dave Masten, the founder and chief technology officer, blamed the delay on the COVID pandemic and industry-wide supply chain issues. [ 108 ] In February 2021, NASA selected Firefly Aerospace for a CLPS launch to Mare Crisium in mid-2023.

[ 129 ] NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine officially announced the Artemis Accords on May 15, 2020. It consists of a series of multilateral agreements between the governments of participating nations in the Artemis program "grounded in the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 ". [ 130 ] [ 131 ] The Artemis Accords have been criticized by some American researchers as "a concerted, strategic effort to redirect international space cooperation in favor of short-term U.S. commercial interests". [ 132 ] Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) [ edit ] Main article: Exploration Ground Systems The Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) Program is one of three NASA programs based at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. EGS was established to develop and operate the systems and facilities necessary to process and launch rockets and spacecraft during assembly, transport, and launch. [ 133 ] EGS is preparing the infrastructure to support NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and its payloads, such as the Orion spacecraft for Artemis I. [ 134 ] [ 135 ] Gateway Logistics Services [ edit ] Main article: Gateway Logistics Services The Lunar Gateway is a space station to be constructed in lunar orbit, and the Gateway Logistics Services program will provide cargo and other supplies to the station, even when crews are not present. [ 136 ] As of 2022 [update] , only SpaceX's supply vehicle, known as Dragon XL , is planned to supply the Gateway. Dragon XL is a version of the Dragon spacecraft , to be launched by the Falcon Heavy . Unlike Dragon 2 and its predecessor, it is intended to be an expendable spacecraft. Supporting Earth-launch vehicles [ edit ] As of the early mission concepts outlined by NASA in May 2020 and refined by the HLS contract award in July 2021, the primary Earth-launch vehicles planned to support the Artemis program will include the NASA Space Launch System for the Orion vehicle , the Falcon Heavy for various components of the Lunar Gateway , [ 137 ] and the Starship HLS configuration for the eventual delivery of the HLS vehicle . Other standard SpaceX Starships may be used later to meet other and yet to be determined crew and/or cargo handling mission needs. [ 138 ] Additional launch vehicles will also be employed later for CLPS cargo services. The European Ariane 6 has been proposed to be part of the program in July 2019. [ 139 ] The Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) module and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) of the Gateway , which were previously planned for the SLS Block 1B , [ 140 ] will now fly together on a Falcon Heavy in 2027. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] [ 143 ] The Gateway will be supported and resupplied by approximately 28 commercial cargo missions launched by undetermined commercial launch vehicles. [ 144 ] The Gateway Logistics Services (GLS) will be in charge of resupply missions. [ 144 ] GLS has also contracted for the construction of a resupply vehicle, Dragon XL, capable of remaining docked to the Gateway for one year of operations, providing and generating its own power while docked, and capable of autonomous disposal at the end of its mission. [ 144 ] [ 145 ] [ 146 ] In May 2019, the plan was for components of a crewed lunar lander to be deployed to the Gateway on commercial launchers before the arrival of the first crewed mission, Artemis III . [ 147 ] An alternative approach where the HLS and Orion dock together directly was discussed. [ 148 ] [ 149 ] As late as mid-2019, NASA considered use of Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy to launch a crewed Orion mission given SLS delays. [ 150 ] Given the complexity of conversion to a different vehicle, the agency ultimately decided to use only the SLS to launch astronauts.

May require refueling launches LEO: Low Earth Orbit TLI: Trans-Lunar Injection Space Launch System [ edit ] Main article: Space Launch System The planned evolution of the Space Launch System , the primary launch vehicle for Orion The Space Launch System (SLS) is a United States super heavy-lift expendable launch vehicle , which has been under development since its announcement in 2011. The SLS is the main Earth-launch vehicle of the Artemis lunar program, as of March 2021 [update] . NASA is required by the U.S. Congress to use SLS Block 1, which will be powerful enough to lift a payload of 95 metric tons (209,000 lb) to low Earth orbit (LEO), and will launch Artemis I , II , and III . [ 167 ] [ 168 ] [ 169 ] Starting in 2028, Block 1B is intended to debut the Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) and launch the notional Artemis IV–VII. [ 170 ] [ 171 ] Starting in 2029, Block 2 is planned to replace the initial Shuttle-derived boosters with advanced boosters and would have a LEO capability of more than 130 metric tons (290,000 lb), again as required by Congress. [ 172 ] Block 2 is intended to enable crewed launches to Mars . [ 6 ] The SLS will launch the Orion spacecraft and use the ground operations capabilities and launch facilities at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida . The SLS for Artemis I on its mobile launcher, getting ready for a wet dress rehearsal ahead of launch In March 2019, the Trump administration released its Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Request for NASA. This budget did not initially include any money for the Block 1B and Block 2 variants of SLS, but later a request for a budget increase of $1.6 billion towards SLS, Orion, and crewed landers was made. Block 1B is now intended to debut on Artemis IV and will be used mainly for co-manifested crew transfers and logistics rather than constructing the Gateway as initially planned. An uncrewed Block 1B was planned to launch the Lunar Surface Asset in 2028, the first lunar outpost of the Artemis program, but now that launch has been moved to a commercial launcher. [ 173 ] Block 2 development will most likely start in the late 2020s after NASA is regularly visiting the lunar surface and shifts focus towards Mars. [ 174 ] In October 2019, NASA authorized Boeing to purchase materials in bulk for more SLS rockets ahead of the announcement of a new contract. The contract was expected to support up to ten core stages and eight Exploration Upper Stages for the SLS 1B to transfer heavy payloads of up to 40 metric tons on a lunar trajectory. [ 175 ] Potential cancellation [ edit ] Boeing, the main contractor for the SLS, informed its employees working on the rocket on February 7, 2025, that they may be laid off when its contract expires, suggesting the Trump Administration may propose canceling the SLS. [ 176 ] [ 177 ] The release of Trump's fiscal year 2026 budget proposal for NASA on May 2 involved cutting $6 billion (24%) from NASA's $24.8 billion budget and allocating $1 billion to SpaceX. [ 178 ] [ 179 ] Had this occurred, the budget would have cancelled the SLS and Orion spacecraft after Artemis III due to the SLS's cost of $4 billion per launch, [ 180 ] as well as the Lunar Gateway . [ 181 ] [ 182 ] Outcome [ edit ] On July 4, 2025, President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act , which allocates $10 billion for NASA; this includes $700 million for a Mars Telecommunications Orbiter (a project which was initially cancelled in 2005); $2.6 billion for the Lunar Gateway space station; $4.1 billion for the development of the Space Launch System rockets for the Artemis IV and Artemis V missions; $20 million for the Artemis IV Orion spacecraft; $1.25 billion for International Space Station operations throughout 2030; $325 million for the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle ; $1 billion for improvements at five NASA centers ($300 million for Johnson Space Center , $250 million for Kennedy Space Center , $120 million for Stennis Space Center , $100 million for Marshall Space Flight Center and $30 million for Michoud Assembly Facility ); $85 million will also be allocated to transfer a space vehicle to a field center that is involved in the administration of the Commercial Crew Program (aimed at moving Space Shuttle Discovery to the Johnson Space Center). This measure indicates that a cancellation of the Artemis program is highly unlikely. [ 183 ] [ 184 ] [ 185 ] SpaceX Starship [ edit ] Main article: SpaceX Starship The SpaceX Starship system is a fully-reusable super heavy-lift Earth-launch system which is under development. It consists of a first-stage booster named Super-Heavy and a second-stage space vehicle which is generally named Starship and which will have several variants. A Starship HLS mission will use three variants: a tanker, a propellant depot, and the Starship HLS itself which will be designed only for lunar landings and takeoffs, and not for Earth landings. Some variants will be able to return to Earth for reuse. The second-stage Starships are fully self-contained spacecraft, complete with their own propulsion systems. The combined Starship system using standard Starship variants for its second-stage is planned to launch crews and cargo, which may then be used to support the various developmental needs of the Artemis program, and also to support the needs of other NASA and SpaceX programs. The SpaceX Starship is also qualified to be bid for Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) launches, and in 2021 was the winning NASA bid for a crewed lunar landing. [ 186 ] [ 187 ] [ 188 ] Falcon Heavy [ edit ] Main article: Falcon Heavy The SpaceX Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable heavy-lift launcher. It will be used to launch the first two Gateway modules into NRHO. [ 189 ] It will also be used to launch the Dragon XL spacecraft on supply missions to Gateway, [ 190 ] and it is qualified to be bid for other launches under the CLPS program. It was selected under CLPS to launch the VIPER mission, though this mission was later cancelled in 2024 due to cost overruns and mission delays. [ 191 ] CLPS launchers [ edit ] Under the CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Service) program, qualified CLPS vendors can use any launcher that meets their mission requirements. Space vehicles [ edit ] Orion [ edit ] Main article: Orion (spacecraft) NASA's Orion spacecraft undergoing final tests Orion is a class of partially reusable spacecraft to be used in the Artemis program. The spacecraft consists of a Crew Module (CM) space capsule designed by Lockheed Martin and the European Service Module (ESM) manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space . Capable of supporting a crew of six beyond low Earth orbit , Orion is equipped with solar panels , an automated docking system , and glass cockpit interfaces modeled after those used in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner . It has a single AJ10 engine for primary propulsion, and others including reaction control system engines. Although designed to be compatible with other launch vehicles , Orion is primarily intended to launch atop a Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, with a tower launch escape system . Orion was originally conceived by Lockheed Martin as a proposal for the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) to be used in NASA's Constellation program . Following the cancellation of the Constellation program in 2010, Orion was heavily redesigned for use in NASA's Journey to Mars initiative; later named Moon to Mars. The SLS replaced the Ares I as Orion's primary launch vehicle, and the service module was replaced with a design based on the European Space Agency 's Automated Transfer Vehicle . A development version of Orion's CM was launched in 2014 during Exploration Flight Test-1 , while at least four test articles were produced. By 2022, three flight-worthy Orion crew modules have been built, with an additional one ordered, for use in the Artemis program; the first of these was due to be launched on November 30, 2020, however, Artemis I did not launch until November 16, 2022. A conceptual advanced Gateway depicting what Gateway could look like in the late 2020s. Dragon XL [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from SpaceX Dragon § Dragon XL . [ edit ] Rendering of the proposed SpaceX Dragon XL On March 27, 2020, SpaceX revealed the Dragon XL resupply spacecraft to carry pressurized and unpressurized cargo, experiments and other supplies to NASA's planned Lunar Gateway under a Gateway Logistics Services (GLS) contract. [ 192 ] [ 193 ] The equipment delivered by Dragon XL missions could include sample collection materials, spacesuits and other items astronauts may need on the Gateway and on the surface of the Moon , according to NASA . It will launch on SpaceX Falcon Heavy rockets from LC-39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida . [ 194 ] The Dragon XL will stay at the Gateway for 6 to 12 months at a time, when research payloads inside and outside the cargo vessel could be operated remotely, even when crews are not present. [ 194 ] Its payload capacity is expected to be more than 5,000 kilograms (11,000 lb) to lunar orbit. [ 195 ] There is no requirement for a return to Earth. At the end of the mission the Dragon XL must be able to undock and dispose of the same mass it can bring to the Gateway, by moving the spacecraft to a heliocentric orbit. [ 196 ] On February 22, 2023, NASA discussed the Dragon XL's development for the first time since its 2020 unveiling, with Mark Wiese, NASA's manager of deep space logistics for the Gateway program, answering during a panel at SpaceCom that NASA has been working with SpaceX to run a series of studies to refine the Dragon XL design and examine cargo configurations and other capabilities that could be enabled by the spacecraft. [ 197 ] Wiese also elaborated that Dragon XL would be used for initial missions, and stating that "[NASA] talked to [SpaceX] about Starship evolution and how it all worked together, but we’re not there yet because it's still in a development phase" hinting that Starship will eventually replace Dragon XL once it completes development. [ 197 ] On March 29, 2024, NASA released an article outlining the mission of Artemis IV , which is to be the first crewed mission to the Lunar Gateway slated for 2028, stating that the Dragon XL will be used to resupply and carry science experiments, however, Artemis IV will take place concurrently with a Starship launch which will dock at the Gateway and help with the assembly of the station. [ 198 ] Human Landing System (HLS) [ edit ] The Human Landing System (HLS) is a critical component of the Artemis mission. This system transports crew from lunar orbit (the Gateway or an Orion spacecraft) to the lunar surface, acts as a lunar habitat, and then transports the crew back to lunar orbit. In 2021 SpaceX's Starship HLS program was awarded the winning NASA bid for the production of a crewed lunar landing vehicle. [ 186 ] In May 2023, Blue Origin was selected as the second provider for lunar lander services. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Early developmental history of the HLS vehicle [ edit ] Main article: Artemis HLS development history Bidding for NASA's HLS lunar landing vehicle began in 2019. At that time, NASA elected to have the HLS designed and developed by commercial vendors. Eleven competing contracts were initially awarded in May 2019. In April 2020, NASA awarded three competing design contracts, and in April 2021, NASA selected the Starship HLS to proceed to development and production. Separate from its early design and development program for its first HLS spacecraft, NASA retains multiple smaller contracts to study various elements of alternative HLS designs. Starship HLS [ edit ] Main article: Starship HLS The Starship Human Landing System (Starship HLS) was the winner selected by NASA for potential use for long-duration crewed lunar landings as part of NASA's Artemis program. [ 53 ] [ 201 ] Starship HLS is a variant of SpaceX's Starship spacecraft optimized to operate on and around the Moon. In contrast to the Starship spacecraft from which it derives, Starship HLS will never re-enter an atmosphere, so it does not have a heat shield or flight control surfaces . In contrast to other proposed HLS designs that used multiple stages, the entire spacecraft will land on the Moon and will then launch from the Moon. Like other Starship variants, Starship HLS has Raptor engines mounted at the tail as its primary propulsion system. However, when it is within "tens of meters" of the lunar surface during descent and ascent, it will use high-thrust methane/oxygen RCS thrusters located mid-body instead of the Raptors to avoid raising dust via plume impingement . A solar array located on the nose below the docking port provides electrical power. Elon Musk stated that Starship HLS would be able to deliver "potentially up to 200 tons" to the lunar surface. Starship HLS would be launched to Earth orbit using the SpaceX Super Heavy booster , and would use a series of tanker spacecraft to refuel the Starship HLS vehicle in Earth orbit for lunar transit and lunar landing operations, a capability referred to as orbital refueling . Starship HLS would then boost itself to lunar orbit for rendezvous with Orion. In the mission concept, a NASA Orion spacecraft would carry a NASA crew to the lander, where they would depart and descend to the surface of the Moon. After lunar surface operations, Starship HLS would lift off from the lunar surface acting as a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicle and return the crew to Orion. Blue Origin HLS [ edit ] Main article: Blue Moon (spacecraft) On May 19, 2023, NASA announced an additional contract to Blue Origin to develop a second crewed lunar lander, which will make its first crewed flight as part of the Artemis V mission. Blue Moon is smaller than the SpaceX HLS lander, having only 20 tons of payload capacity. The lander is fueled with a combination of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants. [ 202 ] Lunar Gateway [ edit ] Main article: Lunar Gateway NASA's Gateway is an in-development mini-space station in lunar orbit intended to serve as a solar-powered communication hub, science laboratory, short-term habitation module, and holding area for rovers and other robots. [ 203 ] While the project is led by NASA, the Gateway is meant to be developed, serviced, and used in collaboration with commercial and international partners: Canada ( Canadian Space Agency ) (CSA), Europe ( European Space Agency ) (ESA), and Japan ( JAXA ). Phase 1 early Gateway with Power and Propulsion Element (left), Habitation and Logistics Outpost (center foreground), and cargo spacecraft (center background) depicted The Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) started development at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory during the now canceled Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM). The original concept was a robotic, high performance solar electric spacecraft that would retrieve a multi-ton boulder from an asteroid and bring it to lunar orbit for study. [ 204 ] When ARM was canceled, the solar electric propulsion was repurposed for the Gateway. [ 205 ] [ 206 ] The PPE will allow access to the entire lunar surface and act as a space tug for visiting craft. [ 207 ] It will also serve as the command and communications center of the Gateway. [ 208 ] [ 209 ] The PPE is intended to have a mass of 8–9 tonnes and the capability to generate 50 kW [ 210 ] of solar electric power for its ion thrusters , which can be supplemented by chemical propulsion. [ 211 ] The Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO), [ 212 ] [ 213 ] also called the Minimal Habitation Module (MHM) and formerly known as the Utilization Module, [ 214 ] will be built by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems (NGIS). [ 215 ] [ 216 ] A single Falcon Heavy equipped with an extended fairing [ 217 ] will launch the PPE together with the HALO in 2027. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] The HALO is based on a Cygnus Cargo resupply module [ 215 ] to the outside of which radial docking ports, body mounted radiators (BMRs), batteries and communications antennae will be added. The HALO will be a scaled-down habitation module, [ 218 ] yet, it will feature a functional pressurized volume providing sufficient command, control, and data handling capabilities, energy storage and power distribution, thermal control, communications and tracking capabilities, two axial and up to two radial docking ports, stowage volume, environmental control and life support systems to augment the Orion spacecraft and support a crew of four for at least 30 days. [ 216 ] Gateway design architecture as of October 2020, which includes European, Japanese, and Russian modules In late October 2020, NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) finalized an agreement to collaborate in the Gateway program. ESA will provide a habitat module in partnership with JAXA (I-HAB) and a refueling module ( ESPRIT ). In return, Europe will have three flight opportunities to launch crew aboard the Orion crew capsule, for which they will provide the service module. [ 219 ] [ 220 ] In mid 2024, the HALO module reached substantial completion and entered into the stress test phase, following successful completion of which it will be shipped from Europe to the US in preparation for configuration with the PPE module and launch. [ 221 ] Astronauts [ edit ] On January 10, 2020, NASA's 22nd astronaut group , nicknamed the "Turtles", graduated and were assigned to the Artemis program. The group includes two Canadian Space Agency (CSA) astronauts. The group earned their nickname from the prior astronaut group, " The 8-Balls ", as is a tradition dating back to " The Mercury Seven " in 1962 which subsequently provided the " Next Nine " with their nickname. They were given this name, for the most part, because of Hurricane Harvey . Some of the astronauts will fly on the Artemis missions to the Moon and may be part of the first crew to fly to Mars. [ 222 ] Artemis team [ edit ] On December 9, 2020, vice president Mike Pence announced the first group of 18 astronauts (all American, including 9 male and 9 female from different backgrounds), the 1st Artemis team , who could be selected as astronauts of early missions of the Artemis program: [ 223 ] Joe Acaba Kayla Barron Raja Chari Matthew Dominick Victor Glover Warren Hoburg Jonny Kim Christina Koch Kjell Lindgren Nicole Mann Anne McClain Jessica Meir Jasmin Moghbeli Kathleen Rubins Francisco Rubio Scott D. Tingle Jessica Watkins Stephanie Wilson Chief Astronaut Reid Wiseman said in August 2022, however, that all 42 active members of the NASA Astronaut Corps and ten more training as NASA Astronaut Group 23 are eligible for Artemis II and later flights. [ 224 ] Planned surface operations [ edit ] An artist's rendition of an Artemis astronaut wearing the xEMU spacesuit and xPLS life support backpack during an EVA on the Moon The Artemis Base Camp will support missions of up to two months and will be used to study technologies to use on future Moon or Mars bases, and then future stationary modules may be used regularly for decades to come through both Government and commercial programs. Most probably it will be a site that has already been visited by prior robotic missions. It will consist of three main modules: 1 The Surface Habitat (SH) modules, which is the initial dwelling structure and a surface home base for the first residents of the Moon.
2 The Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV), which is an unpressurized rover cart for transporting suited astronauts and cargo around in the vicinity of the Base.
3 The Pressurized Rovers (PR), a pressurized vehicle complete with small backup habitation facilities, thus enabling multi-day and longer-range explorations tens of kilometers away from the Base. [ 225 ] Transportation on the Moon [ edit ] Landing zone [ edit ] In 2022, NASA has identified 13 candidate regions near the lunar South Pole for initial landing and inspection missions. [ 226 ] Ground transportation development [ edit ] Main article: Lunar Terrain Vehicle NASA's baseline Lunar Terrain Vehicle In February 2020, NASA released two requests for information regarding both a crewed and uncrewed unpressurized surface rover. The latter, Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) would be prepositioned by a CLPS vehicle before the Artemis III mission. It would be used to transport crews around the exploration site and serve a similar function to the Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle . In July 2020, NASA established a program office for the rover at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. [ 227 ] NASA has specified its need for a Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) that has a cargo capacity of 800 kg, traversal distances of up to 20 km without battery recharging, continuous operations for 8 hours within a 24-hour period, the ability to survive the lunar night, and the ability to traverse grades as steep as ±20 degrees. [ 225 ] On April 3, 2024, NASA announced that Intuitive Machines , Lunar Outpost and Venturi Astrolab are the three companies developing the LTV in a 12-month feasibility and demo phase. [ 228 ] A source selection statement by NASA provided further details on cost and overall feasibility on April 9, 2024. The Intuitive Machines proposal was for $1.692 billion, Lunar Outpost for $1.727 billion and Astrolab for $1.928 billion to develop the vehicle. [ 229 ] Shelter building construction [ edit ] See also: NASA lunar outpost concepts and Moonbase Artist's impression of Artemis Base Camp The Artemis Base Camp is the proposed lunar base to be established at the end of the 2020s. The Base camp is to be located in the south pole region near the two adjacent Shackleton and de Gerlache craters, [ 230 ] due to this area's wide variety of lunar geography and also due to the abundance of water ice that is believed to exist in the lunar soils of the crater floors. The environs of these craters fall under the guidelines of the Outer Space Treaty . [ 227 ] [ 231 ] Foundational Surface Habitat [ edit ] A render of the Foundational Surface Habitat (stationary configuration) Most of the information about the Surface Habitat (SH) modules comes from studies and launch manifests which include a reference to its launch. It will be commercially built and commercially launched in the early 2030s along with the Pressurized Vehicle (PV) . [ 232 ] The SH was formerly referred to as the Artemis Surface Asset. Launch plans as of February 2020 [update] showed that landing it on the surface would be similar to the HLS. The SH would be sent to the Gateway where it would then be attached to a descent stage and subsequently transported to the lunar surface with a commercial launcher and lander. It would use the same lunar transfer stage as used for the HLS. Other designs from 2019 envisioned it being launched from an SLS Block 1B as a single unit and landing directly on the surface. It would then be hooked up to a surface power system launched by a CLPS mission and tested by the Artemis VI crew. [ 227 ] [ 233 ] The Italian Space Agency signed a contract with Thales Alenia Space in late 2023 for the Multi Purpose Habitation module, which may become the second module for the Artemis Base Camp. [ 234 ] [ 235 ] Resource prospecting and research programs [ edit ] As of February 2020, a lunar stay during a Phase 1 Artemis mission will be about seven days and will have five extravehicular activities (EVA). A notional concept of operations, i.e., a hypothetical but possible plan, would include the following: On Day 1 of the stay, astronauts touchdown on the Moon but do not conduct an EVA. Instead, they prepare for the EVA scheduled for the next day, in what is referred to as "The Road to EVA". [ 236 ] On Day 2, the astronauts open the hatch on the Human Landing System and embark on EVA 1, which will be six hours long. It will include collecting a contingency sample, conducting public affairs activities, deploying the experiment package, and acquiring samples. The astronauts will stay close to the landing site on this first EVA. EVA 2 begins on day 3. The astronauts characterize and collect samples from permanently shadowed regions . Unlike the previous EVA, the astronauts will go farther from the landing site, up to 2 kilometres (1.2 mi), and up and down slopes of 20°. [ 236 ] Day 4 will not include an EVA, but Day 5 will. EVA 3 may include activities such as collecting samples from an ejecta blanket. Day 6 will have the two astronauts deploy a geotechnical instrument alongside an environmental monitoring station for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) . Day 7 will have the final and shortest EVA. This EVA will last one hour, rather than the others' six hours in duration from egress to ingress, and mostly comprises preparations for the lunar ascent, including jettisoning hardware. Once the final EVA is concluded, the astronauts will return to the Human Landing System and the vehicle will launch from the surface and join up with Orion/Gateway. [ 236 ] Pressurized rover ("Mobile Habitat") [ edit ] Main article: Lunar Cruiser NASA Habitable Mobility Platform based on the past Constellation Space Exploration Vehicle The Pressurized Rover (PR) is a large, pressurized module used to enable crewed operation across large distances and live for multiple days. NASA had developed multiple pressurized rovers including what was formerly called the Space Exploration Vehicle (SEV). This rover was built for the Constellation program and was fabricated and then tested. In the 2020 flight manifest it was later referred to as the "Mobile Habitat" suggesting it could fill a similar role to the ILREC Lunar Bus . It would be ready for the crew to use on the surface but could also be autonomously controlled from the Gateway or other locations. Mark Kirasich, who is the acting director of NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems, has stated that the current plan is to partner with JAXA and Toyota to develop a closed cabin rover to support crews for up to 14 days (currently known as Lunar Cruiser ). "It's very important to our leadership at the moment to involve JAXA in a major surface element", he said. "... The Japanese, and their auto industry, have a very strong interest in rover-type things. So, there was an idea to—even though we have done a lot of work—to let the Japanese lead development of a pressurized rover. So right now, that's the direction we're heading in". In regard to the PR, senior-lunar-scientist Clive Neal said "Under Constellation, NASA had a sophisticated rover put together. It's pretty sad if it's never going to get to the Moon". However Neal also said that he understands the different mission objectives between the Constellation Program and those of the Artemis Program, and the need of the Artemis Program to focus more on international collaboration. [ 227 ] [ 237 ] [ 238 ] [ 239 ] [ 240 ] On April 9, 2024, it was announced that JAXA and NASA had signed an agreement stipulating that Japan would join the pressurized rover collaboration venture and would design, develop, and operate a rover for crewed and uncrewed exploration of the Moon. In return, NASA will provide the launch and delivery of the rover to the Moon, as well as providing seats for two Japanese astronaut missions to the lunar surface, with the goal of these astronauts being the first non-Americans to travel to the Moon's surface. The pressurized rover is planned to accommodate two astronauts for up to 30 days outside. NASA plans to use the pressurized rover from Artemis VII and subsequent missions, over an approximate 10 year lifespan. [ 241 ] Specialized lunar equipment development [ edit ] Artemis space suits [ edit ] xEMU suit for lunar surface extravehicular activity (EVA) The Artemis program will make use of two types of space suit revealed in October 2019: the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) , [ 242 ] and the Orion Crew Survival System (OCSS). [ 243 ] On August 10, 2021, a NASA Office of Inspector General audit reported a conclusion that the spacesuits would not be ready until April 2025 at the earliest, likely delaying the mission from the then planned late 2024. [ 244 ] In response to the IG report, SpaceX indicated that they could provide the suits. [ 245 ] Commercial spacesuits [ edit ] OCSS suit for launch and reentry NASA published a draft RFP to procure commercially-produced spacesuits in order to meet the 2024 schedule. [ 246 ] On June 2, 2022, NASA announced that commercially produced spacesuits would be developed by Axiom Space and Collins Aerospace . [ 247 ] In early 2024, the development reached the critical design and test phase. [ 248 ] [ 249 ] Artemis flights [ edit ] Main article: List of Artemis missions Orion testing [ edit ] Further information: Orion (spacecraft) § Flights A prototype version of the Orion Crew Module was launched on Exploration Flight Test-1 on December 5, 2014 [ 250 ] [ 251 ] atop a Delta IV Heavy rocket. Its reaction control system and other components were tested during two medium Earth orbits , reaching an apogee of 5,800 km (3,600 mi) and crossing the Van Allen radiation belts before making a high-energy re-entry at 32,000 km/h (20,000 mph). [ 252 ] [ 253 ] The Ascent Abort-2 test on July 2, 2019, tested the final iteration of the launch abort system on a 10,000 kg (22,000 lb) Orion boilerplate at maximum aerodynamic load, [ 254 ] [ 255 ] [ 256 ] using a custom Minotaur IV -derived launch vehicle built by Orbital ATK . [ 256 ] [ 257 ] Artemis I–VI [ edit ] As of November 2022 [update] , all crewed Artemis missions will launch on the Space Launch System from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B .

It has since been delayed to mid-2027. [ 269 ] Artemis VII is expected to deliver a crew of four astronauts to a surface lunar outpost known as the Foundation Habitat, along with the Mobile Habitat, which is expected to occur in March 2032. [ 21 ] [ 173 ] The Foundation Habitat would be launched back to back with the Mobile Habitat by an undetermined super heavy launcher [ 173 ] and would be used for extended crewed lunar surface missions. [ 173 ] [ 270 ] [ 271 ] Artemis VIII is expected to deliver a crew of astronauts to a surface lunar outpost , which is expected to occur in 2033, along with Artemis IX in 2034, Artemis X in 2035 and Artemis XI in 2036. [ citation needed ] Prior to each crewed Artemis mission, payloads to the Gateway , such as refueling depots and expendable elements of the lunar lander, would be deployed by commercial launch vehicles.

Mark Whittington, who is a contributor to The Hill and an author of several space exploration studies, stated in an article that the "lunar orbit project doesn't help us get back to the Moon". [ 290 ] Whittington's comments echo the long-standing assertion that diverting to the Moon after the success of the Apollo Program in the 1960s and 1970s will divert from rather than enhance human-crewed space exploration. Aerospace engineer, author, and Mars Society founder Robert Zubrin dislikes the Lunar Gateway component of Artemis. He presented an alternative approach to a 2024 crewed lander called "Moon Direct," a proposed successor to his Mars Direct . Zubrin envisions phasing out the SLS and Orion, replacing them with the SpaceX launch vehicles and the SpaceX Dragon 2 . This would see ferry-lander refueling on the lunar surface via in situ resource utilization with crew transfer from LEO to the lunar surface. The concept resembles NASA's own Space Transportation System proposal from the 1970s. [ 291 ] At least 15 launches will be required to refuel HLS in orbit per crewed mission. [ 292 ] In 2024, SpaceX's Jennifer Jensen stated on a call that Starship HLS will require ten launches. [ 293 ] Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin disagrees with NASA's lunar outpost plan. He questioned the benefit of "send[ing] a crew to an intermediate point in space, pick[ing] up a lander there and go[ing] down." Aldrin has expressed support for Zubrin's "Moon Direct."

[ 262 ] [ 263 ] ^ Director General Josef Aschbacher stated two of the seats are reserved for the European Space Agency. [ 263 ] One of the seats will likely be one of the two seasoned German astronauts with ISS experience; Matthias Maurer or Alexander Gerst , who will participate in the landing attempt while very little is known about who the other candidate is who will stay in orbit, with it likely to be an Italian astronaut; either Luca Parmitano or Samantha Cristoforetti . [ 262 ] ^ The Polish government has stated that one of the seats is reserved for the Polish Space Agency and their astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski ; however, this is yet to be officially confirmed. [ 267 ] [ 268 ] With the ESA announcing that they've reserved three seats in Artemis 5 and 6, it is unclear if the Polish seat still stands as Poland is also a member of the ESA.

It was operated by three trios of astronaut crews: Skylab 2 , Skylab 3 , and Skylab 4 . Skylab was constructed from a repurposed Saturn V third stage (the S-IVB ), and took the place of the stage during launch. Operations included an orbital workshop, a solar observatory , Earth observation and hundreds of experiments . Skylab's orbit eventually decayed and it disintegrated in the atmosphere on July 11, 1979, scattering debris across the Indian Ocean and Western Australia . Overview [ edit ] As of 2025, [update] Skylab has been the only space station operated exclusively by the United States. A permanent station was planned starting in 1988, but its funding was canceled and U.S. participation shifted to the International Space Station in 1993. Skylab had a mass of 199,750 pounds (90,610 kg) with a 31,000-pound (14,000 kg) Apollo command and service module (CSM) attached [ 4 ] and included a workshop, a solar observatory, and several hundred life science and physical science experiments. It was launched uncrewed into low Earth orbit by a Saturn V rocket modified to be similar to the Saturn INT-21 , with the S-IVB , with Skylab itself being the repurposed third stage. This was the final flight for the rocket more commonly known for carrying the crewed Apollo Moon landing missions. [ 5 ] Three subsequent missions delivered three-astronaut crews in the Apollo CSM launched by the smaller Saturn IB rocket. Configuration [ edit ] Skylab included the Apollo Telescope Mount (a multi-spectral solar observatory), a multiple docking adapter with two docking ports, an airlock module with extravehicular activity (EVA) hatches, and the orbital workshop, the main habitable space inside Skylab. Electrical power came from solar arrays and fuel cells in the docked Apollo CSM. The rear of the station included a large waste tank, propellant tanks for maneuvering jets, and a heat radiator. Astronauts conducted numerous experiments aboard Skylab during its operational life.

The station was damaged during launch when the micrometeoroid shield tore away from the workshop, taking one of the main solar panel arrays with it and jamming the other main array. This deprived Skylab of most of its electrical power and also removed protection from intense solar heating, threatening to make it unusable. The first crew deployed a replacement heat shade and freed the jammed solar panels to save Skylab. This was the first time that a repair of this magnitude was performed in space. The Apollo Telescope significantly advanced solar science, and observation of the Sun was unprecedented. Astronauts took thousands of photographs of Earth, and the Earth Resources Experiment Package (EREP) viewed Earth with sensors that recorded data in the visible , infrared , and microwave spectral regions. The record for human time spent in orbit was extended beyond the 23 days set by the Soyuz 11 crew aboard Salyut 1 to 84 days by the Skylab 4 crew. Later plans to reuse Skylab were stymied by delays in the development of the Space Shuttle, and Skylab's decaying orbit could not be stopped. Skylab's atmospheric reentry began on July 11, 1979, [ 7 ] amid worldwide media attention. Before re-entry, NASA ground controllers tried to adjust Skylab's orbit to minimize the risk of debris landing in populated areas, [ 8 ] targeting the south Indian Ocean, which was partially successful. Debris showered Western Australia , and recovered pieces indicated that the station had disintegrated lower than expected. [ 9 ] As the Skylab program drew to a close, NASA's focus had shifted to the development of the Space Shuttle. NASA space station and laboratory projects included Spacelab , Shuttle- Mir , and Space Station Freedom , which was merged into the International Space Station. Background [ edit ] Rocket engineer Wernher von Braun , science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke , and other early advocates of crewed space travel, expected until the 1960s that a space station would be an important early step in space exploration. Von Braun participated in the publishing of a series of influential articles in Collier's magazine from 1952 to 1954, titled " Man Will Conquer Space Soon! ". He envisioned a large, circular station 250 feet (75 m) in diameter that would rotate to generate artificial gravity and require a fleet of 7,000 short tons (6,400 metric tons) space shuttles for construction in orbit. The 80 men aboard the station would include astronomers operating a telescope, meteorologists to forecast the weather, and soldiers to conduct surveillance. Von Braun expected that future expeditions to the Moon and Mars would leave from the station. [ 10 ] The development of the transistor , the solar cell , and telemetry led, in the 1950s and early 1960s, to uncrewed satellites that could take photographs of weather patterns or enemy nuclear weapons and send them to Earth. A large station was no longer necessary for such purposes, and the United States Apollo program to send men to the Moon chose a mission mode that would not need in-orbit assembly. A smaller station that a single rocket could launch retained value, however, for scientific purposes. [ 11 ] Early studies [ edit ] Von Braun's sketch of a Space Station based on conversion of a Saturn V stage, 1964 In 1959, von Braun, head of the Development Operations Division at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency , submitted his final Project Horizon plans to the U.S. Army . The overall goal of Horizon was to place men on the Moon, a mission that would soon be taken over by the rapidly forming NASA. Although concentrating on the Moon missions, von Braun also detailed an orbiting laboratory built out of a Horizon upper stage, [ 12 ] an idea used for Skylab. [ 13 ] A number of NASA centers studied various space station designs in the early 1960s. Studies generally looked at platforms launched by the Saturn V, followed up by crews launched on Saturn IB using an Apollo command and service module , [ 14 ] or a Gemini capsule [ 15 ] on a Titan II-C , the latter being much less expensive in the case where cargo was not needed. Proposals ranged from an Apollo-based station with two to three men, or a small "canister" for four men with Gemini capsules resupplying it, to a large, rotating station with 24 men and an operating lifetime of about five years. [ 16 ] A proposal to study the use of a Saturn S-IVB as a crewed space laboratory was documented in 1962 by the Douglas Aircraft Company . [ 17 ] Air Force plans [ edit ] The Department of Defense (DoD) and NASA cooperated closely in many areas of space. [ 18 ] In September 1963, NASA and the DoD agreed to cooperate in building a space station. [ 19 ] The DoD wanted its own crewed facility, however, [ 20 ] and in December 1963 it announced Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL), a small space station primarily intended for photo reconnaissance using large telescopes directed by a two-person crew. The station was the same diameter as a Titan II upper stage , and would be launched with the crew riding atop in a modified Gemini capsule with a hatch cut into the heat shield on the bottom of the capsule. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] MOL competed for funding with a NASA station for the next five years [ 23 ] and politicians and other officials often suggested that NASA participate in MOL or use the DoD design. [ 20 ] The military project led to changes to the NASA plans so that they would resemble MOL less. [ 19 ] Development [ edit ] NASA's Skylab pre-flight orbital workshop overview, circa 1972 The floor grating of Skylab under construction Apollo Applications Program [ edit ] Main article: Apollo Applications Program NASA management was concerned about losing the 400,000 workers involved in Apollo after landing on the Moon in 1969. [ 24 ] A reason von Braun, head of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center during the 1960s, advocated a smaller station after his large one was not built was that he wished to provide his employees with work beyond developing the Saturn rockets, which would be completed relatively early during Project Apollo. [ 25 ] NASA set up the Apollo Logistic Support System Office, originally intended to study various ways to modify the Apollo hardware for scientific missions. The office initially proposed a number of projects for direct scientific study, including an extended-stay lunar mission which required two Saturn V launchers, a "lunar truck" based on the Lunar Module (LM), a large, crewed solar telescope using an LM as its crew quarters, and small space stations using a variety of LM or CSM-based hardware. Although it did not look at the space station specifically, over the next two years the office became increasingly dedicated to this role. In August 1965, the office was renamed, becoming the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). [ 26 ] As part of their general work, in August 1964 the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) presented studies on an expendable lab known as Apollo X , short for Apollo Extension System . Apollo X would have replaced the LM carried on the top of the S-IVB stage with a small space station slightly larger than the CSM's service area, containing supplies and experiments for missions between 15 and 45 days' duration. Using this study as a baseline, several mission profiles were looked at over the next six months. Wet workshop [ edit ] Main article: Wet workshop An early " wet workshop " version of Skylab In November 1964, von Braun proposed a more ambitious plan to build a much larger station built from the S-II second stage of a Saturn V. His design replaced the S-IVB third stage with an aeroshell, primarily as an adapter for the CSM on top. Inside the shell was a 10 feet (3.0 m) cylindrical equipment section. On reaching orbit, the S-II second stage would be vented to remove any remaining hydrogen fuel, then the equipment section would be slid into it via a large inspection hatch. This became known as a " wet workshop " concept, because of the conversion of an active fuel tank. The station filled the entire interior of the S-II stage's hydrogen tank, with the equipment section forming a "spine" and living quarters located between it and the walls of the booster. This would have resulted in a very large 33 by 45 feet (10 by 14 m) living area. Power was to be provided by solar cells lining the outside of the S-II stage. [ 27 ] One problem with this proposal was that it required a dedicated Saturn V launch to fly the station. At the time the design was being proposed, it was not known how many of the then-contracted Saturn Vs would be required to achieve a successful Moon landing. However, several planned Earth-orbit test missions for the LM and CSM had been canceled, leaving some Saturn IBs free for use. Further work led to the idea of building a smaller "wet workshop" based on the S-IVB, launched as the second stage of a Saturn IB. A number of S-IVB-based stations were studied at MSC from mid-1965, which had much in common with the Skylab design that eventually flew. An airlock would be attached to the hydrogen tank, in the area designed to hold the LM , and a minimum amount of equipment would be installed in the tank in order to avoid taking up too much fuel volume. Floors of the station would be made from an open metal framework that allowed the fuel to flow through it. After launch, a follow-up mission launched by a Saturn IB would launch additional equipment, including solar panels, an equipment section and docking adapter, and various experiments. Douglas Aircraft Company , builder of the S-IVB stage, was asked to prepare proposals along these lines. The company had for several years been proposing stations based on the S-IV stage, before it was replaced by the S-IVB. [ 28 ] On April 1, 1966, MSC sent out contracts to Douglas, Grumman , and McDonnell for the conversion of an S-IVB spent stage, under the name Saturn S-IVB spent-stage experiment support module (SSESM). [ 29 ] In May 1966, astronauts voiced concerns over the purging of the stage's hydrogen tank in space. Nevertheless, in late July 1966, it was announced that the Orbital Workshop would be launched as a part of Apollo mission AS-209, originally one of the Earth-orbit CSM test launches, followed by two Saturn I/CSM crew launches, AAP-1 and AAP-2. The Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) remained AAP's chief competitor for funds, although the two programs cooperated on technology. NASA considered flying experiments on MOL or using its Titan IIIC booster instead of the much more expensive Saturn IB. The agency decided that the Air Force station was not large enough and that converting Apollo hardware for use with Titan would be too slow and too expensive. [ 30 ] The DoD canceled MOL in June 1969. [ 31 ] Dry workshop [ edit ] Design work continued over the next two years, in an era of shrinking budgets. [ 32 ] (NASA sought US$450 million for Apollo Applications in fiscal year 1967, for example, but received US$42 million.) [ 33 ] In August 1967, the agency announced that the lunar mapping and base construction missions examined by the AAP were being canceled. Only the Earth-orbiting missions remained, namely the Orbital Workshop and Apollo Telescope Mount solar observatory . The success of Apollo 8 in December 1968, launched on the third flight of a Saturn V, made it likely that one would be available to launch a dry workshop. [ 34 ] Later, several Moon missions were canceled as well, originally to be Apollo missions 18 through 20 . The cancellation of these missions freed up three Saturn V boosters for the AAP program. Although this would have allowed them to develop von Braun's original S-II-based mission, by this time so much work had been done on the S-IV-based design that work continued on this baseline. With the extra power available, the wet workshop was no longer needed; [ 35 ] the S-IC and S-II lower stages could launch a "dry workshop", with its interior already prepared, directly into orbit. Habitability [ edit ] Jumping and flying in weightlessness A dry workshop simplified plans for the interior of the station. [ 36 ] Industrial design firm Raymond Loewy /William Snaith recommended emphasizing habitability and comfort for the astronauts by providing a wardroom for meals and relaxation [ 37 ] and a window to view Earth and space, although astronauts were dubious about the designers' focus on details such as color schemes. [ 38 ] Habitability had not previously been an area of concern when building spacecraft due to their small size and brief mission durations, but the Skylab missions would last for months. [ 39 ] NASA sent a scientist on Jacques Piccard 's Ben Franklin submarine in the Gulf Stream in July and August 1969 to learn how six people would live in an enclosed space for four weeks. [ 40 ] Astronauts were uninterested in watching movies on a proposed entertainment center or in playing games, but they did want books and individual music choices. [ 38 ] Food was also important; early Apollo crews complained about its quality, and a NASA volunteer found it intolerable to live on the Apollo food for four days on Earth. Its taste and composition were unpleasant, in the form of cubes and squeeze tubes. Skylab food significantly improved on its predecessors by prioritizing palatability over scientific needs. [ 41 ] For sleeping in space , each astronaut had a private area the size of a small walk-in closet , with a curtain, sleeping bag, and locker. [ 42 ] Designers also added a shower [ 43 ] [ 44 ] and a toilet [ 45 ] [ 46 ] for comfort and to obtain precise urine and feces samples for examination on Earth. [ 47 ] The waste samples were so important that they would have been priorities in any rescue mission . [ 48 ] Skylab did not have recycling systems such as the conversion of urine to drinking water; it also did not dispose of waste by dumping it into space. The S-IVB's 73,280 liters (16,120 imp gal; 19,360 U.S. gal) liquid oxygen tank below the Orbital Work Shop was used to store trash and wastewater, passed through an airlock . Operational history [ edit ] Completion and launch [ edit ] Launch of the modified Saturn V rocket carrying the Skylab space station On August 8, 1969, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation received a contract for the conversion of two existing S-IVB stages to the Orbital Workshop configuration. One of the S-IV test stages was shipped to McDonnell Douglas for the construction of a mock-up in January 1970. The Orbital Workshop was renamed "Skylab" in February 1970 as a result of a NASA contest. [ 49 ] The actual stage that flew was the upper stage of the AS-212 rocket (the S-IVB stage, S-IVB 212). The mission computer used aboard Skylab was the IBM System/4Pi TC-1, a relative of the AP-101 Space Shuttle computers. The Saturn V with serial number SA-513, originally produced for the Apollo program – before the cancellation of Apollo 18, 19, and 20 – was repurposed and redesigned to launch Skylab. [ 50 ] The Saturn V's third stage was removed and replaced with Skylab, but with the controlling instrument unit remaining in its standard position. Skylab was launched on May 14, 1973, by the modified Saturn V. The launch is sometimes referred to as Skylab 1. Severe damage was sustained during launch and deployment, including the loss of the station's micrometeoroid shield/sun shade and one of its main solar panels . Debris from the lost micrometeoroid shield became tangled in the remaining solar panel, preventing its full deployment and thus leaving the station with a huge power deficit. [ 51 ] Immediately following Skylab's launch, Pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center was deactivated, and construction proceeded to modify it for the Space Shuttle program, originally targeting a maiden launch in March 1979 . The crewed missions to Skylab would occur using a Saturn IB rocket from Launch Pad 39B. Skylab 1 was the last uncrewed launch from LC-39A until February 19, 2017, when SpaceX CRS-10 was launched from there. Crewed missions [ edit ] Skylab 3's Saturn IB at night, July 1973 Skylab in orbit in 1973 as flown, docking ports in view Three crewed missions, designated Skylab 2 , Skylab 3 , and Skylab 4 , were made to Skylab in Apollo command and service modules . The first crewed mission, Skylab 2, was launched on May 25, 1973, by a Saturn IB and involved extensive repairs to the station. The crew deployed a parasol-like sunshade through a small instrument port from the inside of the station, bringing station temperatures down to acceptable levels and preventing overheating that would have melted the plastic insulation inside the station and released poisonous gases. This solution was designed by Jack Kinzler , who won the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for his efforts. The crew conducted further repairs via two spacewalks ( extravehicular activity or EVA). The crew stayed in orbit with Skylab for 28 days. Two additional missions followed, with the launch dates of July 28, 1973, (Skylab 3) and November 16, 1973, (Skylab 4), and mission durations of 59 and 84 days, respectively. The last Skylab crew returned to Earth on February 8, 1974. [ 52 ] In addition to the three crewed missions, there was a rescue mission on standby that had a crew of two, but could take five back down. Skylab 2: launched May 25, 1973 [ 53 ] Skylab 3: launched July 28, 1973 Skylab 4: launched November 16, 1973 Skylab 5: cancelled Skylab Rescue on standby Also of note was the three-man crew of Skylab Medical Experiment Altitude Test (SMEAT), who spent 56 days in 1972 at low-pressure on Earth to evaluate medical experiment equipment. [ 54 ] This was a spaceflight analog test in full gravity, but Skylab hardware was tested and medical knowledge was gained. Orbital operations [ edit ] Owen Garriott performing an EVA in 1973 Days in space Mission Skylab 2 28 Skylab 3 60 Skylab 4 84 Originally intended to be visited by one 28–day and two 56–day missions for a total of 140 days, [ 55 ] Skylab was ultimately occupied for 171 days and 13 hours during its three crewed expeditions, orbiting the Earth 2,476 times. Each of these extended the human record of 23 days for amount of time spent in space set by the Soviet Soyuz 11 crew aboard the space station Salyut 1 on June 30, 1971. Skylab 2 lasted 28 days, Skylab 3 –  56 days, and Skylab 4 –  84 days. Astronauts performed ten spacewalks, totaling 42 hours and 16 minutes. Skylab logged about 2,000 hours of scientific and medical experiments, 127,000 frames of film of the Sun and 46,000 of Earth. [ 56 ] Solar experiments included photographs of eight solar flares and produced valuable results [ 57 ] that scientists stated would have been impossible to obtain with uncrewed spacecraft. [ 58 ] The existence of the Sun's coronal holes was confirmed because of these efforts. [ 59 ] Many of the experiments conducted investigated the astronauts' adaptation to extended periods of microgravity . A typical day began at 6 a.m. Central Time Zone . [ 60 ] Although the toilet was small and noisy, both veteran astronauts –  who had endured earlier missions' rudimentary waste-collection systems –  and rookies complimented it. [ 61 ] [ 44 ] [ 62 ] The first crew enjoyed taking a shower once a week, but found drying themselves in weightlessness [ 62 ] and vacuuming excess water difficult; later crews usually cleaned themselves daily with wet washcloths instead of using the shower. Astronauts also found that bending over in weightlessness to put on socks or tie shoelaces strained their abdominal muscles. [ 63 ] Breakfast began at 7 a.m. Astronauts usually stood to eat, as sitting in microgravity also strained their abdominal muscles. They reported that their food –  although greatly improved from Apollo –  was bland and repetitive, and weightlessness caused utensils, food containers, and bits of food to float away; also, gas in their drinking water contributed to flatulence . After breakfast and preparation for lunch, experiments, tests and repairs of spacecraft systems and, if possible, 90 minutes of physical exercise followed; the station had a bicycle and other equipment, and astronauts could jog around the water tank. After dinner, which was scheduled for 6 p.m., crews performed household chores and prepared for the next day's experiments. Following lengthy daily instructions (some of which were up to 15 meters long) sent via teleprinter , the crews were often busy enough to postpone sleep. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] The station offered what a later study called "a highly satisfactory living and working environment for crews", with enough room for personal privacy. [ 66 ] Although it had a dart set , [ 67 ] playing cards , and other recreational equipment in addition to books and music players, the window with its view of Earth became the most popular way to relax in orbit. [ 68 ] Experiments [ edit ] Spider Anita flown aboard Skylab Prior to departure about 80 experiments were named, although they are also described as "almost 300 separate investigations". [ 69 ] Experiments were divided into six broad categories: Life science – human physiology , biomedical research ; circadian rhythms (mice, gnats) Solar physics and astronomy – sun observations (eight telescopes and separate instrumentation); Comet Kohoutek (Skylab 4); stellar observations; space physics Earth resources – mineral resources ; geology ; hurricanes ; land and vegetation patterns Material science – welding, brazing, metal melting; crystal growth ; water / fluid dynamics Student research – 19 different student proposals. Several experiments were commended by the crew, including a dexterity experiment and a test of web-spinning by spiders in low gravity. Other – human adaptability, ability to work, dexterity ; habitat design/operations. Because the solar scientific airlock – one of two research airlocks – was unexpectedly occupied by the "parasol" that replaced the missing meteorite shield, a few experiments were instead installed outside with the telescopes during spacewalks or shifted to the Earth-facing scientific airlock. Skylab 2 spent less time than planned on most experiments due to station repairs. On the other hand, Skylab 3 and Skylab 4 far exceeded the initial experiment plans, once the crews adjusted to the environment and established comfortable working relationships with ground control. The figure (below) lists an overview of most major experiments. [ 70 ] Skylab 4 carried out several more experiments, such as to observe Comet Kohoutek . [ 71 ] Overview of most major experiments Astronaut maneuvering equipment [ edit ] As a technology demonstration, the crew practiced flying the Automatically Stabilized Maneuvering Unit (ASMU) inside the spacious dome of the Orbital Workshop. Designed to enable astronauts to perform untethered movements in microgravity. [ 72 ] The ASMU tests established key piloting characteristics and capability base for the MMU systems used on the Space Shuttle missions. [ 73 ] Nobel Prize [ edit ] Riccardo Giacconi shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics for his study of X-ray astronomy , including the study of emissions from the Sun onboard Skylab, contributing to the birth of X-ray astronomy . [ 74 ] Film vaults and window radiation shield [ edit ] A labeled illustration of a Skylab film vault, from Skylab: A Guidebook (EP-107) by NASA Skylab had certain features to protect vulnerable technology from radiation . [ 75 ] The window was vulnerable to darkening, and this darkening could affect experiment S190. [ 75 ] As a result, a light shield that could be open or shut was designed and installed on Skylab. [ 75 ] To protect a wide variety of films, used for a variety of experiments and for astronaut photography , there were five film vaults. [ 75 ] There were four smaller film vaults in the Multiple Docking Adapter , mainly because the structure could not carry enough weight for a single larger film vault. [ 75 ] The orbital workshop could handle a single larger safe, which is also more efficient for shielding. [ 75 ] A later example of a radiation vault is the Juno Radiation Vault for the Juno Jupiter orbiter, launched in 2011, which was designed to protect much of the uncrewed spacecraft's electronics, using 1 cm thick walls of titanium . [ 76 ] The large vault in the orbital workshop had an empty mass of 2,398 pounds (1,088 kg). [ 75 ] The four smaller vaults had combined mass of 1,545 lb (701 kg). [ 75 ] The primary construction material of all five safes was aluminum. [ 75 ] When Skylab re-entered there was one 180 pounds (82 kg) chunk of aluminum found that was thought to be a door to one of the film vaults. [ 77 ] The large film vault was one of the heaviest single pieces of Skylab to re-enter Earth's atmosphere . [ 78 ] The Skylab film vault was used for storing film from various sources including the Apollo Telescope Mount solar instruments. [ 79 ] Six ATM experiments used film to record data, and over the course of the missions over 150,000 successful exposures were recorded. [ 79 ] The film canister had to be manually retrieved on crewed spacewalks to the instruments during the missions. [ 79 ] The film canisters were returned to Earth aboard the Apollo capsules when each mission ended, and were among the heaviest items that had to be returned at the end of each mission. [ 79 ] The heaviest canisters weighed 40 kg and could hold up to 16,000 frames of film. [ 79 ] Gyroscopes [ edit ] Skylab could change its attitude without using propellant by changing the spin of large gyroscopes. There were two types of gyroscopes on Skylab. Control-moment gyroscopes (CMG) could physically move the station, and rate gyroscopes measured the rate of rotation to find its orientation. [ 80 ] The CMG helped provide the fine pointing needed by the Apollo Telescope Mount, and to resist various forces that can change the station's orientation. [ 81 ] Some of the forces acting on Skylab that the pointing system needed to resist: [ 81 ] Gravity gradient Aerodynamic disturbance Internal movements of crew. The Skylab-A attitude and pointing control system has been developed to meet the high accuracy requirements established by the desired experiment conditions. Conditions must be maintained by the control system under the influence of external and internal disturbance torques, such as gravity gradient and aerodynamic disturbances and onboard astronaut motion. — Skylab Attitude and Pointing Control System (NASA Technical Note D-6068) This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain . [ 81 ] Skylab was the first large spacecraft to use big gyroscopes, capable of controlling its attitude. [ 82 ] The control could also be used to help point the instruments. [ 82 ] The gyroscopes took about ten hours to get spun up if they were turned off. [ 83 ] There was also a thruster system to control Skylab's attitude. [ 83 ] There were 9 rate-gyroscope sensors, 3 for each axis. [ 83 ] These were sensors that fed their output to the Skylab digital computer. [ 83 ] Two of three were active and their input was averaged, while the third was a backup. [ 83 ] From NASA SP-400 Skylab, Our First Space Station , "each Skylab control-moment gyroscope consisted of a motor-driven rotor, electronics assembly, and power inverter assembly. The 21-inch-diameter (530 mm) rotor weighed 155 pounds (70 kg) and rotated at approximately 8950 revolutions per minute". [ 84 ] There were three control moment gyroscopes on Skylab, but only two were required to maintain pointing. [ 84 ] The control and sensor gyroscopes were part of a system that help detect and control the orientation of the station in space. [ 84 ] Other sensors that helped with this were a Sun tracker and a star tracker . [ 84 ] The sensors fed data to the main computer, which could then use the control gyroscopes and or the thruster system to keep Skylab pointed as desired. [ 84 ] Shower [ edit ] Astronaut Jack Lousma in the shower with curtain partially down, July 1973 Conrad in the Skylab shower in 1973 Earth testing showing partially and fully enclosed positions of the shower curtain Skylab had a zero-gravity shower system in the work and experiment section of the Orbital Workshop [ 85 ] designed and built at the Manned Spaceflight Center . [ 54 ] It had a cylindrical curtain that went from floor to ceiling and a vacuum system to suck away water. [ 86 ] The floor of the shower had foot restraints. To bathe, the user coupled a pressurized bottle of warmed water to the shower's plumbing, then stepped inside and secured the curtain. A push-button shower nozzle was connected by a stiff hose to the top of the shower. [ 54 ] [ 87 ] The system was designed for about 6 pints (2.8 liters) of water per shower, [ 88 ] the water being drawn from the personal hygiene water tank. [ 54 ] The use of both the liquid soap and water was carefully planned out, with enough soap and warm water for one shower per week per person. [ 85 ] The first astronaut to use the space shower was Paul J. Weitz on Skylab 2, the first crewed mission. [ 85 ] He said, "It took a fair amount longer to use than you might expect, but you come out smelling good". [ 85 ] A Skylab shower took about two and a half hours, including the time to set up the shower and dissipate used water. [ 89 ] The procedure for operating the shower was as follows: [ 87 ] Fill up the pressurized water bottle with hot water and attach it to the ceiling Connect the hose and pull up the shower curtain Spray down with water Apply liquid soap and spray more water to rinse Vacuum up all the fluids and stow items. One of the big concerns with bathing in space was control of droplets of water so that they did not cause an electrical short by floating into the wrong area. [ 90 ] The vacuum water system was thus integral to the shower. The vacuum fed to a centrifugal separator, filter, and collection bag to allow the system to vacuum up the fluids. [ 87 ] Waste water was injected into a disposal bag which was in turn put in the waste tank. [ 54 ] The material for the shower enclosure was fire-proof beta cloth wrapped around hoops of 43 inches (1,100 mm) diameter; the top hoop was connected to the ceiling. [ 54 ] The shower could be collapsed to the floor when not in use. [ 87 ] Skylab also supplied astronauts with rayon terrycloth towels which had a color-coded stitching for each crew-member. [ 85 ] There were 420 towels on board Skylab initially. [ 85 ] A simulated Skylab shower was also used during the 56-day SMEAT simulation; the crew used the shower after exercise and found it a positive experience. [ 91 ] Cameras and film [ edit ] A view of the Skylab space station taken with a hand-held 70 mm Hasselblad camera using a 100 mm lens and SO-368 medium speed Ektachrome film Hurricane Ellen of 1973, as seen from Skylab The island of Crete as photographed on June 22, 1973, from Skylab Skylab as Skylab 2 mission departs There was a variety of hand-held and fixed experiments that used various types of film. In addition to the instruments in the ATM solar observatory, 35 and 70 mm film cameras were carried on board. An analog TV camera was carried that recorded video electronically. These electronic signals could be recorded to magnetic tape or be transmitted to Earth by radio signal. It was determined that film would fog up due to radiation over the course of the mission. [ 75 ] To prevent this, film was stored in vaults. [ 75 ] Personal (hand-held) camera equipment: [ 92 ] Television camera Westinghouse color 25–150 mm zoom 16 mm film camera (Maurer), called the 16 mm Data Acquisition Camera. [ 92 ] The DAC was capable of very low frame rates, such as for engineering data films, and it had independent shutter speeds. [ 93 ] It could be powered from a battery or from Skylab itself. [ 93 ] It used interchangeable lenses, and various lens and also film types were used during the missions. [ 93 ] There were different options for frame rates : 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 frames per second [ 92 ] Lenses available: 5, 10, 18, 25, 75, and 100 mm Films used: Ektachrome film SO-368 film SO-168 film Film for the DAC was contained in DAC film magazines, which contained up to 140 feet (43 m) of film. [ 94 ] At 24 frames per second this was enough for 4 minutes of filming, with progressively longer film times with lower frame rates such as 16 minutes at 6 frames per second. [ 93 ] The film had to be loaded or unloaded from the DAC in a photographic dark room . [ 93 ] 35 mm film cameras ( Nikon ) [ 92 ] There were 5 Nikon 35 mm film cameras on board, with 55 mm and 300 mm lenses. [ 95 ] They were specially modified Nikon F cameras [ 96 ] The cameras were capable of interchangeable lenses. [ 96 ] 35mm films included: [ 97 ] Ektachrome SO-368 SO-168 2485 type film 2443 type film 70 mm film camera ( Hasselblad ) [ 92 ] This had an electric data camera system with Reseau plate Films included 70 mm Ektachrome SO-368 film Lenses: 70 mm lens, 100 mm lens. [ 92 ] Experiment S190B was the Actron Earth Terrain Camera. [ 92 ] The S190A was the Multispectral Photographic Camera : [ 92 ] This consisted of six Itek 70 mm boresighted cameras Lenses were f/2.8 with a 21.2° field of view . There was also a Polaroid SX-70 instant camera, [ 98 ] and a pair of Leitz Trinovid 10 × 40 binoculars modified for use in space to aid in Earth observations. [ 92 ] The SX-70 was used to take pictures of the Extreme Ultraviolet monitor by Dr. Garriot, as the monitor provided a live video feed of the solar corona in ultraviolet light as observed by Skylab solar observatory instruments located in the Apollo Telescope Mount . [ 99 ] Computers [ edit ] Computational cycle of the Skylab computer program Skylab was controlled in part by a digital computer system, and one of its main jobs was to control the pointing of the station; pointing was especially important for its solar power collection and observatory functions. [ 100 ] The computer consisted of two actual computers, a primary and a secondary. The system ran several thousand words of code, which was also backed up on the Memory Load Unit (MLU). [ 100 ] The two computers were linked to each other and various input and output items by the workshop computer interface. [ 101 ] Operations could be switched from the primary to the backup, which were the same design, either automatically if errors were detected, by the Skylab crew, or from the ground. [ 100 ] The Skylab computer was a space-hardened and customized version of the TC-1 computer, a version of the IBM System/4 Pi , itself based on the System 360 computer. [ 100 ] The TC-1 had a 16,000-word memory based on ferrite memory cores, while the MLU was a read-only tape drive that contained a backup of the main computer programs. [ 100 ] The tape drive would take 11 seconds to upload the backup of the software program to a main computer. [ 102 ] The TC-1 used 16-bit words and the central processor came from the 4Pi computer. [ 102 ] There was a 16k and an 8k version of the software program. [ 103 ] The computer had a mass of 100 pounds (45 kg), and consumed about ten percent of the station's electrical power . [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Apollo Telescope Mount Digital Computer [ 102 ] Attitude and Pointing Control System (APCS) [ 100 ] Memory Load Unit (MLU). [ 100 ] After launch the computer is what the controllers on the ground communicated with to control the station's orientation. [ 104 ] When the sun-shield was torn off the ground staff had to balance solar heating with electrical production. [ 104 ] On March 6, 1978, the computer system was re-activated by NASA to control the re-entry. [ 105 ] The system had a user interface that consisted of a display, ten buttons, and a three-position switch. [ 106 ] Because the numbers were in octal (base-8), it only had numbers zero to seven (8 keys), and the other two keys were enter and clear. [ 106 ] The display could show minutes and seconds which would count down to orbital benchmarks, or it could display keystrokes when using the interface. [ 106 ] The interface could be used to change the software program. [ 106 ] The user interface was called the Digital Address System (DAS) and could send commands to the computer's command system. The command system could also get commands from the ground. [ 103 ] For personal computing needs Skylab crews were equipped with models of the then new hand-held electronic scientific calculator, which was used in place of slide-rules used on prior space missions as the primary personal computer. The model used was the Hewlett Packard HP 35 . [ 107 ] Some slide rules continued in use aboard Skylab, and a circular slide rule was at the workstation. [ 108 ] Plans for re-use after the last mission [ edit ] Skylab Rescue vehicle Apollo CSM being removed from its Saturn IB rocket after the last Skylab mission Calculations made during the mission, based on current values for solar activity and expected atmospheric density, gave the workshop just over nine years in orbit. Slowly at first – dropping 30 kilometers by 1980 – and then faster – another 100 kilometers by the end of 1982 – Skylab would come down, and some time around March 1983 it would burn up in the dense atmosphere. [ 109 ] After nearly 172 days, Skylab considerably exceeded its planned 140 day habitation. The station had held up relatively well, but its onboard supplies were low and its systems were beginning to degrade. One of the three control-moment gyroscopes (CMGs) failed 8 days into Skylab 4, [ 110 ] and by the end of the mission another was showing signs of impending failure. [ 111 ] With just a single CMG Skylab would be unable to control its attitude, and it was not possible to repair or replace one of the broken gyroscopes on-orbit. Virtually all of the prepackaged food launched with the station had been consumed, Skylab 4's mission extension from 56 to 84 days required the crew take an extra 28 days worth of food with them, [ 112 ] but there was still enough water to support three men for 60 days, and enough oxygen/nitrogen to support the same for 140 days. [ 113 ] A fourth crewed mission using an Apollo CSM was considered, which would have used the launch vehicle kept on standby for the Skylab Rescue mission. This would have been a 20-day mission to boost Skylab to a higher altitude and do more scientific experiments. [ 114 ] Another plan was to use a Teleoperator Retrieval System (TRS) launched aboard the Space Shuttle (then under development), to robotically re-boost the orbit. When Skylab 5 was cancelled, it was expected Skylab would stay in orbit until the 1980s, which was enough time to overlap with the beginning of Shuttle launches. Other options for launching TRS included the Titan III and Atlas-Agena . No option received the level of effort and funding needed for execution before Skylab's sooner-than-expected re-entry. [ 115 ] The Skylab 4 crew left a bag filled with supplies to welcome visitors, and left the hatch unlocked. [ 115 ] Skylab's internal systems were evaluated and tested from the ground, and effort was put into plans for re-using it, as late as 1978. [ 116 ] NASA discouraged any discussion of additional visits due to the station's age, [ 117 ] but in 1977 and 1978, when the agency still believed the Space Shuttle would be ready by 1979, it completed two studies on reusing the station. [ 115 ] [ 118 ] By September 1978, the agency believed Skylab was safe for crews, with all major systems intact and operational. [ 119 ] It still had 180 man-days of water and 420-man-days of oxygen, and astronauts could refill both; [ 115 ] the station could hold up to about 600 to 700 man-days of drinkable water and 420 man-days of food. [ 120 ] Before Skylab 4 left they did one more boost, running the Skylab thrusters for 3 minutes which added 11 km in height to its orbit. Skylab was left in a 433 by 455 km orbit on departure. At this time, the NASA-accepted estimate for its re-entry was nine years. [ 109 ] The studies cited several benefits from reusing Skylab, which one called a resource worth "hundreds of millions of dollars" [ 121 ] with "unique habitability provisions for long duration space flight". [ 122 ] Because no more operational Saturn V rockets were available after the Apollo program, four to five shuttle flights and extensive space architecture would have been needed to build another station as large as Skylab's 12,400 cubic feet (350 m 3 ) volume. [ 123 ] Its ample size – much greater than that of the shuttle alone, or even the shuttle plus Spacelab [ 124 ] – was enough, with some modifications, for up to seven astronauts [ 125 ] of both sexes, [ 126 ] and experiments needing a long duration in space; [ 121 ] even a movie projector for recreation was possible. [ 122 ] Proponents of Skylab's reuse also said repairing and upgrading Skylab would provide information on the results of long-duration exposure to space for future stations. [ 115 ] The most serious issue for reactivation was attitude control , as one of the station's gyroscopes had failed [ 109 ] and the attitude control system needed refueling; these issues would need EVA to fix or replace. The station had not been designed for extensive resupply. However, although it was originally planned that Skylab crews would only perform limited maintenance, [ 127 ] they successfully made major repairs during EVA, such as the Skylab 2 crew's deployment of the solar panel [ 128 ] and the Skylab 4 crew's repair of the primary coolant loop. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] [ 131 ] The Skylab 2 crew fixed one item during EVA by, reportedly, "hit[ting] it with [a] hammer". [ 132 ] Some studies also said, beyond the opportunity for space construction and maintenance experience, reactivating the station would free up shuttle flights for other uses, [ 121 ] and reduce the need to modify the shuttle for long-duration missions . [ 133 ] Even if the station were not crewed again, went one argument, it might serve as an experimental platform. [ 134 ] Shuttle mission plans [ edit ] Concept for proposed Skylab re-boost The reactivation would likely have occurred in four phases: [ 115 ] [ 135 ] An early Space Shuttle flight would have boosted Skylab to a higher orbit, adding five years of operational life. The shuttle might have pushed or towed the station, but attaching a space tug – the Teleoperator Retrieval System (TRS) – to the station would have been more likely, based on astronauts' training for the task. Martin Marietta won the contract for US$26 million to design the apparatus. [ 136 ] TRS would contain about three tons of propellant. [ 137 ] The remote-controlled booster had TV cameras and was designed for duties such as space construction and servicing and retrieving satellites the shuttle could not reach. After rescuing Skylab, the TRS would have remained in orbit for future use. Alternatively, it could have been used to de-orbit Skylab for a safe, controlled re-entry and destruction. [ 138 ] In two shuttle flights, Skylab would have been refurbished. In January 1982, the first mission would have attached a docking adapter and conducted repairs. In August 1983, a second crew would have replaced several system components. In March 1984, shuttle crews would have attached a solar-powered Power Expansion Package, refurbished scientific equipment, and conducted 30- to 90-day missions using the Apollo Telescope Mount and the Earth resources experiments. Over five years, Skylab would have been expanded to accommodate six to eight astronauts, with a new large docking/interface module, additional logistics modules, Spacelab modules and pallets, and an orbital vehicle space dock using the shuttle's external tank . The first three phases would have required about US$60 million in 1980s dollars, not including launch costs. Other options for launching TRS were Titan III or Atlas-Agena . [ 115 ] After departure [ edit ] Skylab in February 1974, as Skylab 4 departs After a boost of 6.8 miles (10.9 km) by Skylab 4's Apollo CSM before its departure in 1974, Skylab was left in a parking orbit of 269 miles (433 km) by 283 miles (455 km) [ 109 ] that was expected to last until at least the early 1980s, based on estimates of the 11-year sunspot cycle that began in 1976. [ 139 ] [ 140 ] In 1962, NASA first considered the potential risks of a space station reentry, but decided not to incorporate a retrorocket system in Skylab due to cost and acceptable risk. [ 141 ] The spent 49-ton Saturn V S-II stage which had launched Skylab in 1973 remained in orbit for almost two years, and made an uncontrolled reentry on January 11, 1975. [ 142 ] The second stage's reentry was mistimed however and deorbited slightly earlier in the orbit than planned. [ 143 ] Solar activity [ edit ] Skylab captured this view of the Sun Solar prominence recorded by Skylab on August 21, 1973 [ 144 ] British mathematician Desmond King-Hele of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) predicted in 1973 that Skylab would de-orbit and crash to Earth in 1979, sooner than NASA's forecast, because of increased solar activity . [ 140 ] Greater-than-expected solar activity [ 145 ] heated the outer layers of Earth's atmosphere and increased drag on Skylab. By late 1977, NORAD also forecast a reentry in mid-1979; [ 139 ] a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientist criticized NASA for using an inaccurate model for the second most-intense sunspot cycle in a century, and for ignoring NOAA predictions published in 1976. [ 146 ] The reentry of the USSR's nuclear powered Kosmos 954 in January 1978, and the resulting radioactive debris fall in northern Canada , drew more attention to Skylab's orbit. Although Skylab did not contain radioactive materials, the State Department warned NASA about the potential diplomatic repercussions of station debris. [ 147 ] Battelle Memorial Institute forecast that up to 25 tons of metal debris could land in 500 pieces over an area 4,000 miles (6,400 km) long and 1,000 miles (1,600 km) wide. The lead-lined film vault, for example, might land intact at 400 feet per second (120 m/s). [ 9 ] Ground controllers re-established contact with Skylab in March 1978 [ 148 ] and recharged its batteries. [ 8 ] Although NASA worked on plans to reboost Skylab with the Space Shuttle through 1978 and the TRS was almost complete, the agency gave up in December 1978 when it became clear that the shuttle would not be ready in time; [ 136 ] [ 149 ] its first flight, STS-1 , did not occur until April 1981. Also rejected were proposals to launch the TRS using one or two uncrewed rockets [ 115 ] or to attempt to destroy the station with missiles. [ 9 ] Skylab's fall to Earth [ edit ] Further information: List of reentering space debris Equirectangular projection relief map of the Skylab re-entry site and final orbits, as predicted by NASA Fragment of Skylab recovered after its re-entry through Earth's atmosphere , on display at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center Skylab's impending demise in 1979 was an international media event, [ 150 ] with T-shirts and hats with bullseyes [ 9 ] and "Skylab Repellent" with a money-back guarantee, [ 151 ] wagering on the time and place of re-entry, and nightly news reports. The San Francisco Examiner offered a US$10,000 prize (equivalent to $44,000 today) [ 152 ] for the first piece of Skylab delivered to its offices; the rival San Francisco Chronicle offered US$200,000 ($887,000 today) [ 152 ] if a subscriber suffered personal or property damage. [ 8 ] A Nebraska neighborhood painted a target so that the station would have "something to aim for", a resident said. [ 151 ] The Examiner created the prize to compete with the Chronicle and its popular columnist Herb Caen . Publisher Reg Murphy was reluctant to pay the money, Jeff Jarvis recalled, but NASA assured Jarvis—Caen's counterpart at the Examiner —that the station would not hit land. [ 153 ] A report commissioned by NASA calculated that the odds were 1 in 152 of debris hitting any human, and odds of 1 in 7 of debris hitting a city of 100,000 people or more. [ 154 ] Special teams were readied to head to any country hit by debris. [ 8 ] The event caused so much panic in the Philippines that President Ferdinand Marcos appeared on national television to reassure the public. [ 140 ] A week before re-entry, NASA forecast that it would occur between July 10 and 14, with July 12 the most likely date, and the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) predicted July 14. [ 140 ] In the hours before the event, ground controllers adjusted Skylab's orientation to minimize the risk of re-entry on a populated area. [ 8 ] They aimed the station at a spot 810 miles (1,300 km) south-southeast of Cape Town , South Africa, and re-entry began at approximately 16:37 UTC, July 11, 1979. [ 7 ] The station did not burn up as fast as NASA expected. Debris landed about 300 miles (480 km) east of Perth , Western Australia due to a four-percent calculation error, [ 7 ] and was found between Esperance, Western Australia and Rawlinna , from 31° to 34° S and 122° to 126° E, about 130–150 km (81–93 mi) radius around Balladonia, Western Australia . Residents and an airline pilot saw dozens of colorful flares as large pieces broke up in the atmosphere; [ 9 ] the debris landed in an almost unpopulated area, but the sightings still caused NASA to fear human injury or property damage. Don Lind, in a 2005 interview, reports no human injuries or deaths. [ 155 ] Stan Thornton found 24 pieces of Skylab at his home in Esperance. After obtaining his first passport, Thornton flew to San Francisco . After waiting one week for Marshall Space Flight Center to authenticate the wreckage, he collected the Examiner prize and another US$1,000 from a Philadelphia businessman who had flown Thornton's family and girlfriend there. [ 153 ] [ 7 ] [ 9 ] Analysis of the debris showed that the station had disintegrated 10 miles (16 km) above the Earth, much lower than expected. [ 9 ] The Shire of Esperance light-heartedly fined NASA A$400 for littering , [ 156 ] and while the fine was indeed written off three months later, it was nonetheless eventually paid on behalf of NASA in April 2009, after Scott Barley of Highway Radio raised the funds from his morning show listeners. [ 157 ] [ 158 ] After the demise of Skylab, NASA focused on the reusable Spacelab module, an orbital workshop that could be deployed with the Space Shuttle and returned to Earth. The next American major space station project was Space Station Freedom , which was merged into the International Space Station in 1993 and launched starting in 1998. Shuttle-Mir was another project and led to the US funding Spektr , Priroda , and the Mir Docking Module in the 1990s. Launchers, rescue, and cancelled missions [ edit ] Launchers [ edit ] Launch vehicles: [ 159 ] SA-513 (Skylab) SA-206 (Skylab 2) SA-207 (Skylab 3) SA-208 (Skylab 4) SA-209 (Skylab Rescue and Skylab 5, not launched) Skylab Revisit [ edit ] In 1971, before Skylab launched, NASA studied the potential of adding another mission to the three already planned. Called Skylab Revisit, two options were examined. First was an open ended mission that would launch within 30 days after Skylab 4, aiming to last 56 days. The second would visit the station a year after the last crew had left to determine the health and habitability of the station after two years in space. Neither option was rated highly. The first option's chance of mission success was considered uncertain at best, and the second's even worse given the expected dearth of food, water, and oxygen supplies and the degraded condition of Skylab's system after two years in orbit. [ 55 ] Skylab Rescue [ edit ] 5-person Apollo Command module for the Apollo Rescue mission SA-209 served on standby for Skylab 4 and ASTP , and has been preserved at the Kennedy Space Center rocket garden. There was a Skylab Rescue mission assembled for the second crewed mission to Skylab, but it was not needed. Another rescue mission was assembled for the last Skylab and was also on standby for ASTP. These missions used a backup Saturn IB rocket ( SA-209 ) and CSM module ( CSM-119 ). Skylab 5 [ edit ] Skylab 5 would have been a short 20-day mission in April 1974 to conduct more scientific experiments and use the Apollo's Service Propulsion System engine to boost Skylab into a higher orbit, supporting later station use by the Space Shuttle. [ 160 ] Vance Brand (commander), William B. Lenoir (science pilot), and Don Lind (pilot) would have been the crew for this mission, with Brand and Lind being the prime crew for the Skylab Rescue flights. [ 114 ] Brand and Lind also trained for a mission that would have aimed Skylab for a controlled deorbit . [ 155 ] Skylab 5 would have used the SA-209 rocket and CMS-119 on standby for Skylab Rescue. Upon its cancellation the rocket was put on display at NASA Kennedy Space Center. [ 159 ] Skylab B [ edit ] Main article: Skylab B In addition to the flown Skylab space station, a second flight-quality backup Skylab space station had been built during the program. NASA considered using it for a second station in May 1973 or later, to be called Skylab B (S-IVB 515), but decided against it. Launching another Skylab with another Saturn V rocket would have been very costly, and it was decided to spend this money on the development of the Space Shuttle instead. NASA transferred Skylab B to the National Air and Space Museum in 1975. On display in the museum's Space Hall since 1976, the orbital workshop has been slightly modified to permit viewers to walk through the living quarters. [ 161 ] [ 55 ] Engineering mock-ups [ edit ] A full-size 1G training mock-up once used for astronaut training is located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center visitor center in Houston , Texas . Another training mockup, originally used at the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator (NBS), is at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama . Originally displayed indoors, it was subsequently stored outdoors for several years to make room for other exhibits. To mark the 40th anniversary of the Skylab program, the Orbital Workshop portion of the trainer was restored and moved into the Davidson Center in 2013.

Originally, the uncrewed launch of Skylab and the three crewed missions to the station were numbered SL-1 through SL-4 . During the preparations for the crewed missions, some documentation was created with a different scheme – SLM-1 through SLM-3 – for those missions only. William Pogue credits Pete Conrad with asking the Skylab program director which scheme should be used for the mission patches , and the astronauts were told to use 1–2–3, not 2–3–4. By the time NASA administrators tried to reverse this decision, it was too late, as all the in-flight clothing had already been manufactured and shipped with the 1–2–3 mission patches.

Lenoir Don Lind (April 1974, cancelled) — N/a 20 (notional) Skylab Rescue — N/a Vance Brand — N/a Don Lind (On Standby) — N/a Predicted to last less than 5 days L.B. James of NASA Marshall predicted in 1970 that an astronomer, medical doctor, and third scientist might compose each Skylab crew. [ 165 ] NASA Astronaut Group 4 and NASA Astronaut Group 6 were scientists recruited as astronauts. They and the scientific community hoped to have two on each Skylab mission, but Deke Slayton , director of flight crew operations, insisted that two trained pilots fly on each. [ 166 ] Although the scientists were qualified jet pilots, NASA headquarters made the final decision of one scientist in each Skylab crew on 6 July 1971, after the deaths of three cosmonauts on Soyuz 11. [ 165 ] Kerwin was the first Skylab scientist-astronaut. NASA chose a medical doctor to better understand the effect of spaceflight on the human body on a long-duration mission. Astronauts trained for minor medical procedures at a Houston hospital emergency department . [ 165 ] SMEAT [ edit ] Main article: Skylab Medical Experiment Altitude Test The Skylab Medical Experiment Altitude Test or SMEAT was a 56-day (8-week) Earth analog Skylab test. [ 167 ] The test had a low-pressure high oxygen-percentage atmosphere but it operated under full gravity, as SMEAT was not in orbit. The test had a three-astronaut crew with Commander Robert Crippen , Pilot Karol J. Bobko , and Science Pilot William E. Thornton ; [ 168 ] there was a focus on medical studies and Thornton was an M.D. [ 169 ] The crew lived and worked in the pressure chamber, converted to be like Skylab, from July 26 to September 20, 1972.

As its three three-person crews spent 510 total man-days in space, each man-day cost approximately US$20 million, compared to US$7.5 million for the International Space Station .

Depictions in fiction [ edit ] A minor storyline of the 1986 film Dogs in Space is an attempt by characters of the Melbourne household to fabricate pieces of Skylab and win a radio station's competition to locate debris from the space station as it fell to earth in Australia. The documentary Searching for Skylab was released online in March 2019. It was written and directed by Dwight Steven-Boniecki and was partly crowdfunded . [ 171 ] The alternate history Apple TV+ original TV series For All Mankind (2019) depicts the use of the space station in the first episode of the second season, surviving to the 1980s and coexisting with the Space Shuttle program in the alternate timeline. [ 172 ] In the 2011 film Skylab , a family gathers in France and waits for the station to fall out of orbit. It was directed by Julie Delpy. [ 173 ] In the 2019 novel Cold Storage by David Koepp , who would later write the script for the 2026 film adaptation , an oxygen tank that survives Skylab's reentry landing in Australia turns out to have a highly infectious and lethal fungus. [ 174 ] The 2021 Indian film Skylab depicts fictitious incidents in a Telangana village preceding the disintegration of the space station. [ 175 ] The 2024 TV series Last Days of the Space Age is set in 1979 Western Australia , during Skylab's reentry near Perth.

Family of European medium- and heavy-lift rocket launch vehicles The first ever Ariane 4 launch from Kourou on June 14, 1988 Ariane ( French: [aʁjan] ) is a series of European civilian expendable launch vehicles for space launch use. The name comes from the French spelling of the mythological character Ariadne . France first proposed the Ariane project and it was officially agreed upon at the end of 1973 after discussions between France, Germany and the UK. The project was Western Europe's second attempt at developing its own launcher following the unsuccessful Europa project. The Ariane project was code-named L3S (the French abbreviation for third-generation substitution launcher). The European Space Agency (ESA) charged Aérospatiale (whose former assets now form Airbus ) with the development of all Ariane launchers and of the testing facilities, while Arianespace handled production, operations and marketing after its creation in 1980. Arianespace launches Ariane rockets from the Guiana Space Centre at Kourou in French Guiana . As a result of the merger in 2000 that founded Airbus, the new corporation's space branch and subsequently its subsidiary with Safran , ArianeGroup , took over the duties of the defunct Aérospatiale.

The first two stages used hypergolic propellants and the third stage used cryogenic liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen (LH2/LOX). Ariane 2–4 were enhancements of the basic vehicle. The major differences are improved versions of the engines , allowing stretched first- and third-stage tanks and greater payloads. The largest versions can launch two satellites , mounted in the SPELDA (Structure Porteuse Externe pour Lancements Doubles Ariane) adapter. Such later versions are often seen with strap-on boosters . These layouts are designated by suffixes after the generation number. First is the total number of boosters, then letters designating liquid - or solid-fuelled stages. For example, an Ariane 42P is an Ariane 4 with two solid-fuel boosters. An Ariane 44LP has two solid, two liquid boosters, and a 44L has four liquid-fuel boosters. Ariane 5 rocket at Le Bourget Air and Space Museum , Paris Ariane 5 is a nearly complete redesign. The two hypergolic lower stages are replaced with a single LH2/LOX core stage. This simplifies the stack, along with the use of a single core engine ( Vulcain ). Because the core cannot lift its own weight, two solid-fuel boosters are strapped to the sides. The boosters can be recovered for examination, but are not reused. There are two versions of the upper stage, one hypergolic and restartable with a single Aestus engine [ 1 ] and the other with a HM7B cryogenic engine burning LH2/LOX. On 4 May 2007, an Ariane 5-ECA rocket set a new commercial payload record, lifting two satellites with a combined mass of 9.4 tonnes. [ 2 ] By January 2006, 169 Ariane flights had boosted 290 satellites, successfully placing 271 of them on orbit (223 main passengers and 48 auxiliary passengers) for a total mass of 575,000 kg successfully delivered on orbit. [ citation needed ] Attesting to the ubiquity of Ariane launch vehicles, France's Cerise satellite , which was orbited by an Ariane 4 in 1995, [ 3 ] struck a discarded Ariane rocket stage in 1996. [ 4 ] The incident marked the first verified case of a collision with a piece of catalogued space debris . [ 5 ] On February 16, 2011, the 200th Ariane rocket was launched, successfully carrying the Johannes Kepler ATV into low Earth orbit and providing International Space Station with supplies. [ 6 ] On November 26, 2019, flight number 250 was performed, lifting two communications satellites : TIBA-1 and Inmarsat-5 F5 (GX5). [ 7 ] On December 25, 2021, Ariane flight VA256 lifted NASA's James Webb Space Telescope towards Earth/Sun Lagrange point L2. [ 8 ] Ariane 5 flew its final mission on 5 July 2023.

This shows how the Spitzer IRAC camera was able to see beyond the wavelengths of Hubble's instruments. The Spitzer Space Telescope , formerly the Space Infrared Telescope Facility ( SIRTF ), was an infrared space telescope that was active between 2003 and 2020. [ 5 ] [ 9 ] Spitzer was the third space telescope dedicated to infrared astronomy, following IRAS (1983) and ISO (1995–1998). It was the first spacecraft to use an Earth-trailing orbit , later used by the Kepler planet-finder. The planned mission period was to be 2.5 years with a pre-launch expectation that the mission could extend to five or slightly more years until the onboard liquid helium supply was exhausted. This occurred on 15 May 2009. [ 10 ] Without liquid helium to cool the telescope to the very low temperatures needed to operate, most of the instruments were no longer usable. However, the two shortest-wavelength modules of the IRAC camera continued to operate with the same sensitivity as before the helium was exhausted, and continued to be used into early 2020 in the Spitzer Warm Mission . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] During the warm mission, the two short wavelength channels of IRAC operated at 28.7 K and were predicted to experience little to no degradation at this temperature compared to the nominal mission. The Spitzer data, from both the primary and warm phases, are archived at the Infrared Science Archive (IRSA). In keeping with NASA tradition, the telescope was renamed after its successful demonstration of operation, on 18 December 2003. Unlike most telescopes that are named by a board of scientists, typically after famous deceased astronomers, the new name for SIRTF was obtained from a contest open to the general public.
The contest led to the telescope being named in honor of astronomer Lyman Spitzer , who had promoted the concept of space telescopes in the 1940s. [ 13 ] Spitzer wrote a 1946 report for RAND Corporation describing the advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory and how it could be realized with available or upcoming technology. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] He has been cited for his pioneering contributions to rocketry and astronomy , as well as "his vision and leadership in articulating the advantages and benefits to be realized from the Space Telescope Program." [ 13 ] The US$776 million [ 16 ] Spitzer was launched on 25 August 2003 at 05:35:39 UTC from Cape Canaveral SLC-17B aboard a Delta II 7920H rocket. [ 3 ] It was placed into a heliocentric (as opposed to a geocentric ) orbit trailing and drifting away from Earth's orbit at approximately 0.1 astronomical units per year (an "Earth-trailing" orbit [ 1 ] ). The primary mirror is 85 centimeters (33 in) in diameter, f /12 , made of beryllium and was cooled to 5.5 K (−268 °C; −450 °F). The satellite contains three instruments that allowed it to perform astronomical imaging and photometry from 3.6 to 160 micrometers, spectroscopy from 5.2 to 38 micrometers, and spectrophotometry from 55 to 95 micrometers.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. ( January 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric transmittance (or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light. By the early 1970s, astronomers began to consider the possibility of placing an infrared telescope above the obscuring effects of Earth's atmosphere. Most of the infrared spectrum is outside the optical window , meaning they are strongly absorbed by the atmosphere, except for the infrared window . In 1979, a report from the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences , A Strategy for Space Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 1980s , identified a Shuttle Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) [ 17 ] as "one of two major astrophysics facilities [to be developed] for Spacelab ", a shuttle-borne platform. Anticipating the major results from an upcoming Explorer satellite and from the Shuttle mission, the report also favored the "study and development of ... long-duration spaceflights of infrared telescopes cooled to cryogenic temperatures [ 18 ] ." The launch in January 1983 of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), jointly developed by the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, to conduct the first far-infrared survey of the sky, whetted the appetites of scientists worldwide for follow-up space missions capitalizing on the rapid improvements in infrared detector technology. Earlier infrared observations had been made by both space-based and ground-based observatories . Ground-based observatories have the drawback that at infrared wavelengths or frequencies , both the Earth's atmosphere and the telescope itself will radiate (glow) brightly. Additionally, the atmosphere is opaque at most infrared wavelengths. This necessitates lengthy exposure times and greatly decreases the ability to detect faint objects. It could be compared to trying to observe the stars in visible light at noon from a telescope built out of light bulbs. Previous space observatories (such as IRAS , the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, and ISO , the Infrared Space Observatory) were launched during the 1980s and 1990s and great advances in astronomical technology have been made since then. The SIRTF in a Kennedy Space Center clean room. The launch of SIRTF in 2003 aboard the 300th Delta rocket. Most of the early concepts envisioned repeated flights aboard the NASA Space Shuttle. This approach was developed in an era when the Shuttle program was expected to support weekly flights of up to 30 days duration. A May 1983 NASA Announcement of Opportunity described SIRTF as a Shuttle-attached mission with an evolving scientific instrument payload. Several flights were anticipated with a probable transition into a more extended mode of operation, possibly in association with a future space platform or space station. SIRTF would be a 1-meter class, cryogenically cooled, multi-user facility consisting of a telescope and associated focal plane instruments mounted on a general-purpose Instrument Pointing System to be developed by NASA Ames . SIRTF would be launched on the Space Shuttle and remain attached to the Shuttle as a Spacelab payload during astronomical observations, after which it would be returned to Earth for refurbishment prior to re-flight. The first flight was expected to occur about 1990 with the succeeding flights anticipated beginning approximately one year later. However, the Spacelab-2 flight aboard STS-51-F showed that the Shuttle environment was poorly suited to an onboard infrared telescope due to contamination from the relatively "dirty" vacuum associated with the orbiters. By September 1983, NASA was considering the "possibility of a long duration [free-flyer] SIRTF mission". [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Spitzer is the only one of the Great Observatories not launched by the Space Shuttle , as was originally intended [ citation needed ] . However, after the 1986 Challenger disaster , the Shuttle-Centaur upper stage, which would have been required to place it into its final orbit, was abandoned. The mission underwent a series of redesigns during the 1990s, primarily due to budget considerations. This resulted in a much smaller but still fully capable mission that could use the smaller Delta II expendable launch vehicle. [ 21 ] Animation of Spitzer Space Telescope Around the Earth Around the Sun - Frame rotating with the Earth Spitzer Space Telescope · Earth · Sun One of the most important advances of this redesign was an Earth-trailing orbit . [ 1 ] Cryogenic satellites that require liquid helium (LHe, T ≈ 4 K) temperatures in near-Earth orbit are typically exposed to a large heat load from Earth, and consequently require large amounts of LHe coolant, which then tends to dominate the total payload mass and limits mission life. Placing the satellite in solar orbit far from Earth allowed innovative passive cooling. The sun shield protected the rest of the spacecraft from the Sun's heat, the far side of the spacecraft was painted black to enhance passive radiation of heat, and the spacecraft bus was thermally isolated from the telescope. All of these design choices combined to drastically reduce the total mass of helium needed, resulting in an overall smaller and lighter payload, resulting in major cost savings, but with a mirror the same diameter as originally designed. This orbit also simplified telescope pointing, but did require the NASA Deep Space Network for communications. [ citation needed ] The primary instrument package (telescope and cryogenic chamber) was developed by Ball Aerospace & Technologies , in Boulder, Colorado . The individual instruments were developed jointly by industrial, academic, and government institutions. The principals were Cornell University , the University of Arizona , the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory , Ball Aerospace , and Goddard Spaceflight Center . The shorter-wavelength infrared detectors were developed by Raytheon in Goleta, California . Raytheon used indium antimonide and a doped silicon detector in the creation of the infrared detectors. These detectors are 100 times more sensitive than what was available at the beginning of the project during the 1980s. [ 22 ] The far-infrared detectors (70–160 micrometers) were developed jointly by the University of Arizona and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using gallium -doped germanium . The spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin . The mission was operated and managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Spitzer Science Center , [ 23 ] located at IPAC on the Caltech campus in Pasadena, California.

You can help by adding to it . ( December 2021 ) Warm mission and end of mission [ edit ] Spitzer ran out of liquid helium coolant on 15 May 2009, which stopped far-IR observations. Only the IRAC instrument remained in use, and only at the two shorter wavelength bands (3.6 μm and 4.5 μm). The telescope equilibrium temperature was then around 30 K (−243 °C; −406 °F), and IRAC continued to produce valuable images at those wavelengths as the "Spitzer Warm Mission". [ 24 ] Late in the mission, ~2016, Spitzer's distance to Earth and the shape of its orbit meant the spacecraft had to pitch over at an extreme angle to aim its antenna at Earth. [ 25 ] The solar panels were not fully illuminated at this angle, and this limited those communications to 2.5 hours due to the battery drain. [ 26 ] The telescope was retired on 30 January 2020 [ 5 ] when NASA sent a shutdown signal to the telescope from the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex (GDSCC) instructing the telescope to go into safe mode. [ 27 ] After receiving confirmation that the command was successful, Spitzer Project Manager Joseph Hunt officially declared that the mission had ended. [ 28 ] Instruments [ edit ] Cryogenic Telescope Assembly (CTA) Spitzer carries three instruments on board: [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) An infrared camera which operated simultaneously on four wavelengths (3.6 μm, 4.5 μm, 5.8 μm and 8 μm). Each module used a 256×256-pixel detector—the short-wavelength pair used indium antimonide technology, the long-wavelength pair used arsenic-doped silicon impurity band conduction technology. [ 33 ] The principal investigator was Giovanni Fazio of Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian ; the flight hardware was built by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center . Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) An infrared spectrometer with four sub-modules which operate at the wavelengths 5.3–14 μm (low resolution), 10–19.5 μm (high resolution), 14–40 μm (low resolution), and 19–37 μm (high resolution). Each module used a 128×128-pixel detector—the short-wavelength pair used arsenic-doped silicon blocked impurity band technology, the long-wavelength pair used antimony-doped silicon blocked impurity band technology. [ 34 ] The principal investigator was James R. Houck of Cornell University ; the flight hardware was built by Ball Aerospace . Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) Three detector arrays in the mid- to far-infrared (128 × 128 pixels at 24 μm , 32 × 32 pixels at 70 μm, 2 × 20 pixels at 160 μm). The 24 μm detector is identical to one of the IRS short-wavelength modules. The 70 μm detector used gallium-doped germanium technology, and the 160 μm detector also used gallium-doped germanium, but with mechanical stress added to each pixel to lower the bandgap and extend sensitivity to this long-wavelength. [ 35 ] The principal investigator was George H. Rieke of the University of Arizona ; the flight hardware was built by Ball Aerospace . All three instruments used liquid helium for cooling the sensors. Once the helium was exhausted, only the two shorter wavelengths in IRAC were used in the "warm mission". A Henize 206 viewed by different instruments in March 2004. The separate IRAC and MIPS images are at right. Results [ edit ] While some time on the telescope was reserved for participating institutions and crucial projects, astronomers around the world also had the opportunity to submit proposals for observing time. Prior to launch, there was a proposal call for large, coherent investigations using Spitzer. If the telescope failed early and/or ran out of cryogen very quickly, these so-called Legacy Projects would ensure the best possible science could be obtained quickly in the early months of the mission. As a requirement tied to the funding these Legacy teams received, the teams had to deliver high-level data products back to the Spitzer Science Center (and the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive ) for use by the community, again ensuring the rapid scientific return of the mission. The international scientific community quickly realized the value of delivering products for others to use, and even though Legacy projects were no longer explicitly solicited in subsequent proposal calls, teams continued to deliver products to the community. The Spitzer Science Center later reinstated named "Legacy" projects (and later still "Exploration Science" projects) in response to this community-driven effort. [ 36 ] Important targets included forming stars ( young stellar objects , or YSOs), planets, and other galaxies. Images are freely available for educational and journalistic purposes. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] The Cepheus C & B Regions. – The Spitzer Space Telescope (30 May 2019). The Spitzer's first light image of IC 1396 . The first released images from Spitzer were designed to show off the abilities of the telescope and showed a glowing stellar nursery, a big swirling, dusty galaxy , a disc of planet-forming debris, and organic material in the distant universe. Since then, many monthly press releases have highlighted Spitzer 's capabilities, as the NASA and ESA images do for the Hubble Space Telescope . As one of its most noteworthy observations, in 2005, Spitzer became one of the first telescopes to directly capture light from exoplanets , namely the "hot Jupiters" HD 209458 b and TrES-1b , although it did not resolve that light into actual images. [ 39 ] This was one of the first times the light from extrasolar planets had been directly detected; earlier observations had been indirectly made by drawing conclusions from behaviors of the stars the planets were orbiting. The telescope also discovered in April 2005 that Cohen-kuhi Tau/4 had a planetary disk that was vastly younger and contained less mass than previously theorized, leading to new understandings of how planets are formed. The Helix Nebula , blue shows infrared light of 3.6 to 4.5 micrometers, green shows infrared light of 5.8 to 8 micrometers, and red shows infrared light of 24 micrometers. In 2004, it was reported that Spitzer had spotted a faintly glowing body that may be the youngest star ever seen. The telescope was trained on a core of gas and dust known as L1014 which had previously appeared completely dark to ground-based observatories and to ISO ( Infrared Space Observatory ), a predecessor to Spitzer. The advanced technology of Spitzer revealed a bright red hot spot in the middle of L1014. Scientists from the University of Texas at Austin , who discovered the object, believe the hot spot to be an example of early star development, with the young star collecting gas and dust from the cloud around it. Early speculation about the hot spot was that it might have been the faint light of another core that lies 10 times further from Earth but along the same line of sight as L1014. Follow-up observation from ground-based near-infrared observatories detected a faint fan-shaped glow in the same location as the object found by Spitzer. That glow is too feeble to have come from the more distant core, leading to the conclusion that the object is located within L1014. (Young et al. , 2004) In 2005, astronomers from the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Whitewater determined, on the basis of 400 hours of observation on the Spitzer Space Telescope, that the Milky Way galaxy has a more substantial bar structure across its core than previously recognized. An artificial color image of the Double Helix Nebula , thought to be generated at the galactic center by magnetic torsion 1000 times greater than the Sun's. Also in 2005, astronomers Alexander Kashlinsky and John Mather of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center reported that one of Spitzer 's earliest images may have captured the light of the first stars in the universe. An image of a quasar in the Draco constellation , intended only to help calibrate the telescope, was found to contain an infrared glow after the light of known objects was removed. Kashlinsky and Mather are convinced that the numerous blobs in this glow are the light of stars that formed as early as 100 million years after the Big Bang , redshifted by cosmic expansion . [ 40 ] In March 2006, astronomers reported an 80- light-year -long (25 pc ) nebula near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, the Double Helix Nebula , which is, as the name implies, twisted into a double spiral shape. This is thought to be evidence of massive magnetic fields generated by the gas disc orbiting the supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center, 300 light-years (92 pc) from the nebula and 25,000 light-years (7,700 pc) from Earth. This nebula was discovered by Spitzer and published in the magazine Nature on 16 March 2006. In May 2007, astronomers successfully mapped the atmospheric temperature of HD 189733 b , thus obtaining the first map of some kind of an extrasolar planet. Starting in September 2006, the telescope participated in a series of surveys called the Gould Belt Survey , observing the Gould's Belt region in multiple wavelengths. The first set of observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope was completed from 21 September 2006 through 27 September. Resulting from these observations, the team of astronomers led by Dr. Robert Gutermuth, of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian reported the discovery of Serpens South , a cluster of 50 young stars in the Serpens constellation. The Andromeda Galaxy imaged by MIPS at 24 micrometers. Scientists have long wondered how tiny silicate crystals, which need high temperatures to form, have found their way into frozen comets, born in the very cold environment of the Solar System's outer edges. The crystals would have begun as non-crystallized, amorphous silicate particles, part of the mix of gas and dust from which the Solar System developed. This mystery has deepened with the results of the Stardust sample return mission, which captured particles from Comet Wild 2 . Many of the Stardust particles were found to have formed at temperatures in excess of 1,000 K. In May 2009, Spitzer researchers from Germany, Hungary, and the Netherlands found that amorphous silicate appears to have been transformed into crystalline form by an outburst from a star. They detected the infrared signature of forsterite silicate crystals on the disk of dust and gas surrounding the star EX Lupi during one of its frequent flare-ups, or outbursts, seen by Spitzer in April 2008. These crystals were not present in Spitzer 's previous observations of the star's disk during one of its quiet periods. These crystals appear to have formed by radiative heating of the dust within 0.5 AU of EX Lupi. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] In August 2009, the telescope found evidence of a high-speed collision between two burgeoning planets orbiting a young star. [ 43 ] In October 2009, astronomers Anne J. Verbiscer, Michael F. Skrutskie, and Douglas P. Hamilton published findings of the " Phoebe ring " of Saturn , which was found with the telescope; the ring is a huge, tenuous disc of material extending from 128 to 207 times the radius of Saturn. [ 44 ] GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL surveys [ edit ] GLIMPSE, the Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire , was a series of surveys that spanned 360° of the inner region of the Milky Way galaxy, which provided the first large-scale mapping of the galaxy. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] It consists of more than 2 million snapshots taken in four separate wavelengths using the Infrared Array Camera. [ 47 ] The images were taken over a 10-year period beginning in 2003 when Spitzer launched. [ 48 ] MIPSGAL, a similar survey that complements GLIMPSE, covers 248° of the galactic disk [ 49 ] using the 24 and 70 μm channels of the MIPS instrument. [ 50 ] On 3 June 2008, scientists unveiled the largest, most detailed infrared portrait of the Milky Way , created by stitching together more than 800,000 snapshots, at the 212th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in St. Louis , Missouri . [ 51 ] [ 52 ] This composite survey is now viewable with the GLIMPSE/MIPSGAL Viewer. [ 53 ] 2010s [ edit ] An arrow points to the embryonic star HOPS-68, where scientists believe forsterite crystals are raining down onto the central dust disk. Spitzer observations, announced in May 2011, indicate that tiny forsterite crystals might be falling down like rain on to the protostar HOPS-68. The discovery of the forsterite crystals in the outer collapsing cloud of the protostar is surprising because the crystals form at lava-like high temperatures, yet they are found in the molecular cloud where the temperatures are about −170 °C (103 K; −274 °F). This led the team of astronomers to speculate that the bipolar outflow from the young star may be transporting the forsterite crystals from near the star's surface to the chilly outer cloud. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] In January 2012, it was reported that further analysis of the Spitzer observations of EX Lupi can be understood if the forsterite crystalline dust was moving away from the protostar at a remarkable average speed of 38 kilometres per second (24 mi/s). It would appear that such high speeds can arise only if the dust grains had been ejected by a bipolar outflow close to the star. [ 56 ] Such observations are consistent with an astrophysical theory, developed in the early 1990s, where it was suggested that bipolar outflows garden or transform the disks of gas and dust that surround protostars by continually ejecting reprocessed, highly heated material from the inner disk, adjacent to the protostar, to regions of the accretion disk further away from the protostar. [ 57 ] In April 2015, Spitzer and the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment were reported as co-discovering one of the most distant planets ever identified: a gas giant about 13,000 light-years (4,000 pc) away from Earth. [ 58 ] An illustration of a brown dwarf combined with a graph of light curves from OGLE-2015-BLG-1319 : Ground-based data (grey), Swift (blue), and Spitzer (red). In June and July 2015, the brown dwarf OGLE-2015-BLG-1319 was discovered using the gravitational microlensing detection method in a joint effort between Swift , Spitzer, and the ground-based Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment , the first time two space telescopes have observed the same microlensing event. This method was possible because of the large separation between the two spacecraft: Swift is in low-Earth orbit while Spitzer is more than one AU distant in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit. [ 1 ] This separation provided significantly different perspectives of the brown dwarf, allowing for constraints to be placed on some of the object's physical characteristics. [ 59 ] Reported in March 2016, Spitzer and Hubble were used to discover the most distant-known galaxy, GN-z11 . This object was seen as it appeared 13.4 billion years ago. [ 60 ] [ 25 ] Spitzer Beyond [ edit ] On 1 October 2016, Spitzer began its Observation Cycle 13, a 2 + 1 ⁄ 2 year extended mission nicknamed Beyond . One of the goals of this extended mission was to help prepare for the James Webb Space Telescope , also an infrared telescope, by identifying candidates for more detailed observations. [ 25 ] Another aspect of the Beyond mission was the engineering challenges of operating Spitzer in its progressing orbital phase. As the spacecraft moved farther from Earth on the same orbital path from the Sun, its antenna had to point at increasingly higher angles to communicate with ground stations; this change in angle imparted more and more solar heating on the vehicle while its solar panels received less sunlight. [ 25 ] Planet hunter [ edit ] An artist's impression of the TRAPPIST-1 system. Spitzer was also put to work studying exoplanets thanks to creatively tweaking its hardware. This included doubling its stability by modifying its heating cycle, finding a new use for the "peak-up" camera, and analyzing the sensor at a sub-pixel level. Although in its "warm" mission, the spacecraft's passive cooling system kept the sensors at 29 K (−244 °C; −407 °F). [ 61 ] Spitzer used the transit photometry and gravitational microlensing techniques to perform these observations. [ 25 ] According to NASA's Sean Carey, "We never even considered using Spitzer for studying exoplanets when it launched. ... It would have seemed ludicrous back then, but now it's an important part of what Spitzer does." [ 25 ] Examples of exoplanets discovered using Spitzer include HD 219134 b in 2015, which was shown to be a rocky planet about 1.5 times as large as Earth in a three-day orbit around its star; [ 62 ] and an unnamed planet found using microlensing located about 13,000 light-years (4,000 pc) from Earth. [ 63 ] In September–October 2016, Spitzer was used to discover five of a total of seven known planets around the star TRAPPIST-1 , all of which are approximately Earth-sized and likely rocky. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Three of the discovered planets are located in the habitable zone , which means they are capable of supporting liquid water given sufficient parameters. [ 66 ] Using the transit method , Spitzer helped measure the sizes of the seven planets and estimate the mass and density of the inner six. Further observations will help determine if there is liquid water on any of the planets.

[ 5 ] It was launched in 2006, becoming the first spacecraft to perform a flyby study of the Pluto system in 2015.  A secondary mission contained a flyby and study of one or more other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) in the decade to follow, where it flew past 486958 Arrokoth in 2019. It was the first space probe to ever take high-resolution photographs of Pluto , in 2015. [ 6 ] It was engineered by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), with a team led by Alan Stern . [ 7 ] New Horizons is the fifth space probe to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the Solar System . On January 19, 2006, New Horizons was launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station by an Atlas V rocket directly into an Earth-and-solar escape trajectory with a speed of about 16.26 km/s (10.10 mi/s; 58,500 km/h; 36,400 mph). It was the fastest (average speed with respect to Earth) human-made object ever launched from Earth. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] It is not the fastest speed recorded for a spacecraft, which, as of 2023, is that of the Parker Solar Probe . After a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 APL , New Horizons proceeded to Jupiter , making its closest approach on February 28, 2007, at a distance of 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles). The Jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased New Horizons ' speed; the flyby also enabled a general test of New Horizons ' scientific capabilities, returning data about the planet's atmosphere , moons , and magnetosphere . Most of the post-Jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to preserve onboard systems, except for brief annual checkouts. [ 12 ] On December 6, 2014, New Horizons was brought back online for the Pluto encounter, and instrument check-out began. [ 13 ] On January 15, 2015, the spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto. On July 14, 2015, at 11:49 UTC , it flew 12,500 km (7,800 mi) above the surface of Pluto, [ 14 ] [ 15 ] which at the time was 34 AU from the Sun , [ 16 ] making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet. [ 17 ] In August 2016, New Horizons was reported to have traveled at speeds of more than 84,000 km/h (52,000 mph). [ 18 ] On October 25, 2016, at 21:48 UTC, the last recorded data from the Pluto flyby was received from New Horizons . [ 19 ] Having completed its flyby of Pluto, [ 20 ] New Horizons then maneuvered for a flyby of Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth (then nicknamed Ultima Thule ), [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] which occurred on January 1, 2019, [ 24 ] [ 25 ] when it was 43.4 AU (6.49 billion km ; 4.03 billion mi ) from the Sun. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] In August 2018, NASA cited results by Alice on New Horizons to confirm the existence of a " hydrogen wall " at the outer edges of the Solar System . This "wall" was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] New Horizons is traveling through the Kuiper belt; it is 62.23 AU (9.31 billion km ; 5.78 billion mi ) from Earth and 62.71 AU (9.38 billion km ; 5.83 billion mi ) from the Sun as of September 2025. [ 28 ] NASA has announced its plan to extend operations for New Horizons until the spacecraft exits the Kuiper belt, which is expected to occur in either 2028 or 2029. [ 29 ] The White House's proposed budget for FY2026 would have cut funding for New Horizons , however the continued funding of the mission was heavily debated in the United States Congress [ 30 ] and a final budget of 24.44 billion [ 31 ] guaranteed the mission continuation. History [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Pluto Early concept art of the New Horizons spacecraft. The mission, led by the Applied Physics Laboratory and Alan Stern , eventually became the first mission to Pluto. In August 1992, JPL scientist Robert Staehle called Pluto discoverer Clyde Tombaugh , requesting permission to visit his planet. "I told him he was welcome to it," Tombaugh later remembered, "though he's got to go one long, cold trip." [ 32 ] The call eventually led to a series of proposed Pluto missions leading up to New Horizons . Stamatios "Tom" Krimigis , head of the Applied Physics Laboratory 's space division, one of many entrants in the New Frontiers Program competition, formed the New Horizons team with Alan Stern in December 2000.  Appointed as the project's principal investigator , Stern was described by Krimigis as "the personification of the Pluto mission". [ 33 ] New Horizons was based largely on Stern's work since Pluto 350 and involved most of the team from Pluto Kuiper Express . [ 34 ] The New Horizons proposal was one of five that were officially submitted to NASA. It was later selected as one of two finalists to be subject to a three-month concept study in June 2001. The other finalist, POSSE (Pluto and Outer Solar System Explorer), was a separate but similar Pluto mission concept by the University of Colorado Boulder , led by principal investigator Larry W. Esposito , and supported by the JPL, Lockheed Martin and the University of California . [ 35 ] However, the APL, in addition to being supported by Pluto Kuiper Express developers at the Goddard Space Flight Center and Stanford University [ 35 ] were at an advantage; they had recently developed NEAR Shoemaker for NASA, which had successfully entered orbit around 433 Eros earlier that year, and would later land on the asteroid to scientific and engineering fanfare. [ 36 ] In November 2001, New Horizons was officially selected for funding as part of the New Frontiers program. [ 37 ] However, the new NASA Administrator appointed by the Bush administration , Sean O'Keefe , was not supportive of New Horizons and effectively canceled it by not including it in NASA's budget for 2003. NASA's Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, Ed Weiler , prompted Stern to lobby for the funding of New Horizons in hopes of the mission appearing in the Planetary Science Decadal Survey , a prioritized "wish list", compiled by the United States National Research Council , that reflects the opinions of the scientific community. [ 33 ] After an intense campaign to gain support for New Horizons , the Planetary Science Decadal Survey of 2003–2013 was published in the summer of 2002. New Horizons topped the list of projects considered the highest priority among the scientific community in the medium-size category; ahead of missions to the Moon, and even Jupiter. Weiler stated that it was a result that "[his] administration was not going to fight". [ 33 ] Funding for the mission was finally secured following the publication of the report. Stern's team was finally able to start building the spacecraft and its instruments, with a planned launch in January 2006 and arrival at Pluto in 2015. [ 33 ] Alice Bowman became Mission Operations Manager (MOM). [ 38 ] Mission profile [ edit ] An artist's impression of New Horizons ' close encounter with the Plutonian system New Horizons is the first mission in NASA's New Frontiers mission category, larger and more expensive than the Discovery missions but smaller than the missions of the Flagship Program. The cost of the mission, including spacecraft and instrument development, launch vehicle, mission operations, data analysis, and education/public outreach, is approximately $700 million over 15 years (2001–2016). [ 39 ] The spacecraft was built primarily by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. The mission's principal investigator is Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute (formerly NASA Associate Administrator). After separation from the launch vehicle, overall control was taken by Mission Operations Center (MOC) at the Applied Physics Laboratory in Howard County, Maryland . The science instruments are operated at Clyde Tombaugh Science Operations Center (T-SOC) in Boulder, Colorado . [ 40 ] Navigation is performed at various contractor facilities, whereas the navigational positional data and related celestial reference frames are provided by the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station through Headquarters NASA and JPL . KinetX is the lead on the New Horizons navigation team and is responsible for planning trajectory adjustments as the spacecraft speeds toward the outer Solar System . Coincidentally the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station was where the photographic plates were taken for the discovery of Pluto's moon Charon . The Naval Observatory itself is not far from the Lowell Observatory where Pluto was discovered. New Horizons was originally planned as a voyage to the only unexplored planet in the Solar System. When the spacecraft was launched, Pluto was still classified as a planet , later to be reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Some members of the New Horizons team, including Alan Stern, disagree with the IAU definition and still describe Pluto as the ninth planet. [ 41 ] Pluto's satellites Nix and Hydra also have a connection with the spacecraft: the first letters of their names (N and H) are the initials of New Horizons . The moons' discoverers chose these names for this reason, plus Nix and Hydra's relationship to the mythological Pluto . [ 42 ] Mementos [ edit ] In addition to the science equipment, there are nine cultural artifacts traveling with the spacecraft. [ 43 ] These include a collection of 434,738 names stored on a compact disc, [ 44 ] [ 45 ] a collection of images of New Horizons project personnel on another CD, a piece of Scaled Composites 's SpaceShipOne , [ 46 ] a "Not Yet Explored" USPS stamp, [ 47 ] [ 48 ] and two copies of the Flag of the United States . [ 49 ] [ 43 ] About 30 grams (1 oz) of Clyde Tombaugh's ashes are aboard the spacecraft, to commemorate his discovery of Pluto in 1930. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] A Florida state quarter coin, whose design commemorates human exploration, is included, officially as a trim weight, [ 52 ] as is a Maryland state quarter to honor the probe's builders. [ 43 ] One of the science packages (a dust counter) is named after Venetia Burney , who, as a child, suggested the name "Pluto" after its discovery. Goal [ edit ] View of Mission Operations at the Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland (July 14, 2015) The goal of the mission is to understand the formation of the Plutonian system, the Kuiper belt, and the transformation of the early Solar System. [ 53 ] The spacecraft collected data on the atmospheres, surfaces, interiors, and environments of Pluto and its moons. It will also study other objects in the Kuiper belt. [ 54 ] "By way of comparison, New Horizons gathered 5,000 times as much data at Pluto as Mariner did at the Red Planet ." [ 55 ] Some of the questions the mission attempts to answer are: What is Pluto's atmosphere made of and how does it behave? What does its surface look like? Are there large geological structures? How do solar wind particles interact with Pluto's atmosphere? [ 56 ] Specifically, the mission's science objectives are to: [ 57 ] Map the surface compositions of Pluto and Charon Characterize the geologies and morphologies of Pluto and Charon Characterize the neutral atmosphere of Pluto and its escape rate Search for an atmosphere around Charon Map surface temperatures on Pluto and Charon Search for rings and additional satellites around Pluto Conduct similar investigations of one or more Kuiper belt objects Design and construction [ edit ] An interactive 3D model of New Horizons This section needs additional citations for verification .

( July 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Spacecraft subsystems [ edit ] New Horizons in a clean room at Kennedy Space Center in 2005 The spacecraft is comparable in size and general shape to a grand piano and has been compared to a piano glued to a cocktail bar-sized satellite dish. [ 58 ] As a point of departure, the team took inspiration from the Ulysses spacecraft, [ 59 ] which also carried a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) and dish on a box-in-box structure through the outer Solar System. Many subsystems and components have flight heritage from APL's CONTOUR spacecraft, which in turn had heritage from APL's TIMED spacecraft. New Horizons ' body forms a triangle, almost 0.76 m (2.5 ft) thick. (The Pioneers have hexagonal bodies, whereas the Voyagers have decagonal bodies, [ 60 ] Galileo an octagonal prism body, [ 61 ] and Cassini–Huygens a dodecagonal prism body. [ 62 ] ) A 7075 aluminium alloy tube forms the main structural column, between the launch vehicle adapter ring at the "rear", and the 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in) radio dish antenna affixed to the "front" flat side. The titanium fuel tank is in this tube. The RTG attaches with a 4-sided titanium mount resembling a gray pyramid or stepstool. Titanium provides strength and thermal isolation. The rest of the triangle is primarily sandwich panels of thin aluminum face sheet (less than 1 ⁄ 64 in or 0.40 mm) bonded to aluminum honeycomb core. The structure is larger than strictly necessary, with empty space inside. The structure is designed to act as shielding , reducing electronics errors caused by radiation from the RTG. Also, the mass distribution required for a spinning spacecraft demands a wider triangle. The interior structure is painted black to equalize temperature by radiative heat transfer. Overall, the spacecraft is thoroughly blanketed to retain heat. Unlike the Pioneers and Voyagers , the radio dish is also enclosed in blankets that extend to the body. The heat from the RTG adds warmth to the spacecraft while it is in the outer Solar System. While in the inner Solar System, the spacecraft must prevent overheating, hence electronic activity is limited, power is diverted to shunts with attached radiators, and louvers are opened to radiate excess heat. While the spacecraft is cruising inactively in the cold outer Solar System, the louvers are closed, and the shunt regulator reroutes power to electric heaters . Propulsion and attitude control [ edit ] New Horizons has both spin-stabilized (cruise) and three-axis stabilized (science) modes controlled entirely with hydrazine monopropellant . Additional post launch delta- v of over 290 m/s (1,000 km/h; 650 mph) is provided by a 77 kg (170 lb) internal tank. Helium is used as a pressurant, with an elastomeric diaphragm assisting expulsion. The spacecraft's on-orbit mass including fuel is over 470 kg (1,040 lb) on the Jupiter flyby trajectory, but would have been only 445 kg (981 lb) for the backup direct flight option to Pluto. Significantly, had the backup option been taken, this would have meant less fuel for later Kuiper belt operations. There are 16 thrusters on New Horizons : four 4.4 N (1.0 lbf ) and twelve 0.9 N (0.2 lbf) plumbed into redundant branches. The larger thrusters are used primarily for trajectory corrections, and the small ones (previously used on Cassini and the Voyager spacecraft) are used primarily for attitude control and spinup/spindown maneuvers. Two star cameras are used to measure the spacecraft attitude. They are mounted on the face of the spacecraft and provide attitude information while in spin-stabilized or 3-axis mode. In between the time of star camera readings, spacecraft orientation is provided by dual redundant miniature inertial measurement units . Each unit contains three solid-state gyroscopes and three accelerometers . Two Adcole Sun sensors provide attitude determination. One detects the angle to the Sun, whereas the other measures spin rate and clocking. Power [ edit ] New Horizons ' RTG A cylindrical radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) protrudes in the plane of the triangle from one vertex of the triangle. The RTG provided 245.7 W of power at launch, and was predicted to drop approximately 3.5 W every year, decaying to 202 W by the time of its encounter with the Plutonian system in 2015 and will decay too far to power the transmitters in the 2030s. [ 7 ] There are no onboard batteries since RTG output is predictable, and load transients are handled by a capacitor bank and fast circuit breakers. As of January 2019, the power output of the RTG is about 190 W . [ 63 ] The RTG, model " GPHS-RTG ", was originally a spare from the Cassini mission. The RTG contains 9.75 kg (21.5 lb) of plutonium-238 oxide pellets. [ 34 ] Each pellet is clad in iridium , then encased in a graphite shell. It was developed by the U.S. Department of Energy at the Materials and Fuels Complex, a part of the Idaho National Laboratory . [ 64 ] The original RTG design called for  10.9 kg (24 lb) of plutonium, but a unit less powerful than the original design goal was produced because of delays at the United States Department of Energy, including security activities, that delayed plutonium production. [ 65 ] The mission parameters and observation sequence had to be modified for the reduced wattage; still, not all instruments can operate simultaneously. The Department of Energy transferred the space battery program from Ohio to Argonne in 2002 because of security concerns. The amount of radioactive plutonium in the RTG is about one-third the amount on board the Cassini–Huygens probe when it launched in 1997. The Cassini launch had been protested by multiple organizations, due to the risk of such a large amount of plutonium being released into the atmosphere in case of an accident. The United States Department of Energy estimated the chances of a launch accident that would release radiation into the atmosphere at 1 in 350, and monitored the launch [ 66 ] because of the inclusion of an RTG on board. It was estimated that a worst-case scenario of total dispersal of on-board plutonium would spread the equivalent radiation of 80% the average annual dosage in North America from background radiation over an area with a radius of 105 km (65 mi). [ 67 ] Flight computer [ edit ] The spacecraft carries two computer systems: the Command and Data Handling system and the Guidance and Control processor. Each of the two systems is duplicated for redundancy , for a total of four computers. The processor used for its flight computers is the Mongoose-V , a 12 MHz radiation-hardened version of the MIPS R3000 CPU . Multiple redundant clocks and timing routines are implemented in hardware and software to help prevent faults and downtime. To conserve heat and mass, spacecraft and instrument electronics are housed together in IEMs (integrated electronics modules). There are two redundant IEMs. Including other functions such as instrument and radio electronics, each IEM contains 9 boards. [ 68 ] The software of the probe runs on Nucleus RTOS operating system. [ 69 ] There have been two "safing" events, that sent the spacecraft into safe mode : On March 19, 2007, the Command and Data Handling computer experienced an uncorrectable memory error and rebooted itself, causing the spacecraft to go into safe mode. The craft fully recovered within two days, with some data loss on Jupiter's magnetotail . No impact on the subsequent mission was expected. [ 70 ] On July 4, 2015, there was a CPU safing event triggered by an over-assignment of commanded science operations on the craft's approach to Pluto. Fortunately, the craft was able to recover within two days without major impacts on its mission. NASA scientists therefore reduced the number of scientific operations on the craft to prevent future events, which could happen during the approach with Pluto. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] Telecommunications and data handling [ edit ] New Horizons ' antenna , with some test equipment attached. Communication with the spacecraft is via X band . The craft had a communication rate of 38 kbit/s at Jupiter; at Pluto's distance, a rate of approximately 1 kbit/s per transmitter was expected. Besides the low data rate, Pluto's distance also causes a latency of about 4.5 hours (one-way). The 70 m (230 ft) NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) dishes are used to relay commands once the spacecraft is beyond Jupiter.  The spacecraft uses dual modular redundancy transmitters and receivers, and either right- or left-hand circular polarization . The downlink signal is amplified by dual redundant 12-watt traveling-wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs) mounted on the body under the dish. The receivers are low-power designs. The system can be controlled to power both TWTAs at the same time, and transmit a dual-polarized downlink signal to the DSN that nearly doubles the downlink rate. DSN tests early in the mission with this dual polarization combining technique were successful, and the capability was declared to be operational (when the spacecraft power budget permits both TWTAs to be powered). In addition to the high-gain antenna , there are two backup low-gain antennas and a medium-gain dish. The high-gain dish has a Cassegrain reflector layout, composite construction, of 2.1-meter (7 ft) diameter providing over 42 dBi of gain and a half-power beam width of about a degree. The prime-focus medium-gain antenna, with a 0.3-meter (1 ft) aperture and 10° half-power beam width, is mounted to the forward-facing side of the high-gain antenna's secondary reflector. The forward low-gain antenna is stacked atop the feed of the medium-gain antenna. The aft low-gain antenna is mounted within the launch adapter at the rear of the spacecraft. This antenna was used only for early mission phases near Earth, just after launch and for emergencies if the spacecraft had lost attitude control. New Horizons recorded scientific instrument data to its solid-state memory buffer at each encounter, then transmitted the data to Earth. Data storage is done on two low-power solid-state recorders (one primary, one backup) holding up to 8 gigabyte s each. Because of the extreme distance from Pluto and the Kuiper belt, only one buffer load at those encounters can be saved. This is because New Horizons would require approximately 16 months after leaving the vicinity of Pluto to transmit the buffer load back to Earth. [ 73 ] At Pluto's distance, radio signals from the space probe back to Earth took four hours and 25 minutes to traverse 4.7 billion km of space. [ 74 ] Part of the reason for the delay between the gathering of and transmission of data is that all of the New Horizons instrumentation is body-mounted. In order for the cameras to record data, the entire probe must turn, and the one-degree-wide beam of the high-gain antenna was not pointing toward Earth.  Previous spacecraft, such as the Voyager program probes, had a rotatable instrumentation platform (a "scan platform") that could take measurements from virtually any angle without losing radio contact with Earth. New Horizons was mechanically simplified to save weight, shorten the schedule, and improve reliability during its 15-year designed lifetime. Instruments [ edit ] New Horizons carries seven instruments: three optical instruments, two plasma instruments, a dust sensor and a radio science receiver/radiometer. The instruments are to be used to investigate the global geology, surface composition, surface temperature, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature and escape rate of Pluto and its moons. The rated power is 21 watts , though not all instruments operate simultaneously. [ 75 ] In addition, New Horizons has an Ultrastable Oscillator subsystem, which may be used to study and test the Pioneer anomaly towards the end of the spacecraft's life. [ 76 ] Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) [ edit ] LORRI—long-range camera Main article: Long Range Reconnaissance Imager The Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) is a long-focal-length imager designed for high resolution and responsivity at visible wavelengths. The instrument is equipped with a 1024×1024 pixel by 12-bits-per-pixel monochromatic CCD imager giving a resolution of 5 μrad (~1 arcsec ). [ 77 ] The CCD is chilled far below freezing by a passive radiator on the antisolar face of the spacecraft. This temperature differential requires insulation and isolation from the rest of the structure. The 208.3 mm (8.20 in) aperture Ritchey–Chretien mirrors and metering structure are made of silicon carbide to boost stiffness, reduce weight and prevent warping at low temperatures. The optical elements sit in a composite light shield and mount with titanium and fiberglass for thermal isolation. Overall mass is 8.6 kg (19 lb), with the optical tube assembly (OTA) weighing about 5.6 kg (12 lb), [ 78 ] for one of the largest silicon-carbide telescopes flown at the time (now surpassed by Herschel ). For viewing on public web sites the 12-bit per pixel LORRI images are converted to 8-bit per pixel JPEG images. [ 77 ] These public images do not contain the full dynamic range of brightness information available from the raw LORRI images files. [ 77 ] Principal investigator: Andy Cheng, Applied Physics Laboratory , Data: LORRI image search at jhuapl.edu [ 79 ] Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) [ edit ] SWAP – Solar Wind Around Pluto Main article: SWAP (New Horizons) Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) is a toroidal electrostatic analyzer and retarding potential analyzer (RPA), that makes up one of the two instruments comprising New Horizons ' Plasma and high-energy particle spectrometer suite (PAM), the other being PEPSSI. SWAP measures particles of up to 6.5 keV and, because of the tenuous solar wind at Pluto's distance, the instrument is designed with the largest aperture of any such instrument ever flown. [ 80 ] Principal investigator: David McComas, Southwest Research Institute Pluto Energetic Particle Spectrometer Science Investigation (PEPSSI) [ edit ] Main article: Pluto Energetic Particle Spectrometer Science Investigation Pluto Energetic Particle Spectrometer Science Investigation (PEPSSI) is a time of flight ion and electron sensor that makes up one of the two instruments comprising New Horizons ' plasma and high-energy particle spectrometer suite (PAM), the other being SWAP. Unlike SWAP, which measures particles of up to 6.5 keV, PEPSSI goes up to 1 MeV. [ 80 ] The PEPSSI sensor has been designed to measure the mass, energy and distribution of charged particles around Pluto, and is also able to differentiate between protons , electrons , and other heavy ions . [ 81 ] Principal investigator: Ralph McNutt Jr., Applied Physics Laboratory Alice [ edit ] Main article: Alice (spacecraft instrument) Alice is an ultraviolet imaging spectrometer that is one of two photographic instruments comprising New Horizons ' Pluto Exploration Remote Sensing Investigation (PERSI); the other being the Ralph telescope. It resolves 1,024 wavelength bands in the far and extreme ultraviolet (from 50– 180 nm ), over 32 view fields. Its goal is to determine the composition of Pluto's atmosphere. This Alice instrument is derived from another Alice aboard ESA 's Rosetta spacecraft. [ 80 ] The instrument has a mass of 4.4 kg and draws 4.4 watts of power. Its primary role is to determine the relative concentrations of various elements and isotopes in Pluto's atmosphere. [ 82 ] Principal investigator: Alan Stern, Southwest Research Institute In August 2018, NASA confirmed, based on results by Alice on the New Horizons spacecraft, a " hydrogen wall " at the outer edges of the Solar System that was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Ralph telescope [ edit ] Ralph —telescope and color camera Main article: Ralph (New Horizons) The Ralph telescope,  75 mm [ 83 ] in aperture, is one of two photographic instruments that make up New Horizons ' Pluto Exploration Remote Sensing Investigation (PERSI), with the other being the Alice instrument. Ralph has two separate channels: MVIC (Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera), a visible-light CCD imager with broadband and color channels; and LEISA (Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array), a near- infrared imaging spectrometer. LEISA is derived from a similar instrument on the Earth Observing-1 spacecraft. Ralph was named after Alice's husband on The Honeymooners , and was designed after Alice. [ 84 ] On June 23, 2017, NASA announced that it has renamed the LEISA instrument to the "Lisa Hardaway Infrared Mapping Spectrometer" in honor of Lisa Hardaway , the Ralph program manager at Ball Aerospace , who died in January 2017 at age 50. [ 85 ] Principal investigator: Alan Stern, Southwest Research Institute Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter (VBSDC) [ edit ] VBSDC—Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter The Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter (VBSDC), built by students at the University of Colorado Boulder, is operating periodically to make dust measurements. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] It consists of a detector panel, about 460 mm × 300 mm (18 in × 12 in), mounted on the anti-solar face of the spacecraft (the ram direction), and an electronics box within the spacecraft. The detector contains fourteen polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) panels, twelve science and two reference, which generate voltage when impacted. Effective collecting area is 0.125 m 2 (1.35 sq ft). No dust counter has operated past the orbit of Uranus ; models of dust in the outer Solar System, especially the Kuiper belt, are speculative. The VBSDC is always turned on measuring the masses of the interplanetary and interstellar dust particles (in the range of nano- and picograms) as they collide with the PVDF panels mounted on the New Horizons spacecraft. The measured data is expected to greatly contribute to the understanding of the dust spectra of the Solar System. The dust spectra can then be compared with those from observations of other stars, giving new clues as to where Earth-like planets can be found in the universe. The dust counter is named for Venetia Burney , who first suggested the name "Pluto" at the age of 11. A thirteen-minute short film about the VBSDC garnered an Emmy Award for student achievement in 2006. [ 88 ] Principal investigator: Mihaly Horanyi, University of Colorado Boulder Radio Science Experiment (REX) [ edit ] Main article: REX (New Horizons) The Radio Science Experiment (REX) used an ultrastable crystal oscillator (essentially a calibrated crystal in a miniature oven ) and some additional electronics to conduct radio science investigations using the communications channels. These are small enough to fit on a single card. Because there are two redundant communications subsystems, there are two, identical REX circuit boards. Principal investigators: Len Tyler and Ivan Linscott, Stanford University Journey to Pluto [ edit ] Main article: Timeline of New Horizons Launch [ edit ] Launch of New Horizons . The Atlas V rocket on the launchpad (left) and lift off from Cape Canaveral. On September 24, 2005, the spacecraft arrived at the Kennedy Space Center on board a C-17 Globemaster III for launch preparations. [ 89 ] The launch of New Horizons was originally scheduled for January 11, 2006, but was initially delayed until January 17, 2006, to allow for borescope inspections of the Atlas V 's kerosene tank. Further delays related to low cloud ceiling conditions downrange , and high winds and technical difficulties—unrelated to the rocket itself—prevented launch for a further two days. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] The probe finally lifted off from Pad 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , Florida , directly south of Space Shuttle Launch Complex 39 , at 19:00 UTC on January 19, 2006. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] The Centaur second stage ignited at 19:04:43 UTC and burned for 5 minutes 25 seconds. It reignited at 19:32 UTC and burned for 9 minutes 47 seconds. The ATK Star 48 B third stage ignited at 19:42:37 UTC and burned for 1 minute 28 seconds. [ 94 ] Combined, these burns successfully sent the probe on a solar-escape trajectory at 16.26 kilometers per second (58,536 km/h; 36,373 mph). [ 9 ] New Horizons took only nine hours to pass the Moon's orbit. [ 95 ] Although there were backup launch opportunities in February 2006 and February 2007, only the first twenty-three days of the 2006 window permitted the Jupiter flyby. Any launch outside that period would have forced the spacecraft to fly a slower trajectory directly to Pluto, delaying its encounter by five to six years. [ 96 ] The probe was launched by a Lockheed Martin Atlas V 551 rocket, with a third stage added to increase the heliocentric (escape) speed. This was the first launch of the Atlas V 551 configuration, which uses five solid rocket boosters , and the first Atlas V with a third stage. Previous flights had used zero, two, or three solid boosters, but never five. The vehicle, AV-010, weighed 573,160 kilograms (1,263,600 lb) at lift-off, [ 94 ] and had earlier been slightly damaged when Hurricane Wilma swept across Florida on October 24, 2005. One of the solid rocket boosters was hit by a door. The booster was replaced with an identical unit, rather than inspecting and requalifying the original. [ 97 ] The launch was dedicated to the memory of launch conductor Daniel Sarokon , who was described by space program officials as one of the most influential people in the history of space travel. [ 98 ] Inner Solar System [ edit ] Trajectory corrections [ edit ] On January 28 and 30, 2006, mission controllers guided the probe through its first trajectory -correction maneuver (TCM), which was divided into two parts (TCM-1A and TCM-1B). The total velocity change of these two corrections was about 18 meters per second (65 km/h; 40 mph). TCM-1 was accurate enough to permit the cancellation of TCM-2, the second of three originally scheduled corrections. [ 99 ] On March 9, 2006, controllers performed TCM-3, the last of three scheduled course corrections. The engines burned for 76 seconds, adjusting the spacecraft's velocity by about 1.16 m/s (4.2 km/h; 2.6 mph). [ 100 ] Further trajectory maneuvers were not needed until September 25, 2007 (seven months after the Jupiter flyby), when the engines were fired for 15 minutes and 37 seconds, changing the spacecraft's velocity by 2.37 m/s (8.5 km/h; 5.3 mph), [ 101 ] followed by another TCM, almost three years later on June 30, 2010, that lasted 35.6 seconds, when New Horizons had already reached the halfway point (in time traveled) to Pluto. [ 102 ] In-flight tests and crossing of Mars orbit [ edit ] During the week of February 20, 2006, controllers conducted initial in-flight tests of three onboard science instruments, the Alice ultraviolet imaging spectrometer, the PEPSSI plasma-sensor, and the LORRI long-range visible-spectrum camera. No scientific measurements or images were taken, but instrument electronics, and in the case of Alice, some electromechanical systems were shown to be functioning correctly. [ 103 ] On April 7, 2006, the spacecraft passed the orbit of Mars, moving at roughly 21 km/s (76,000 km/h; 47,000 mph) away from the Sun at a solar distance of 243 million kilometers. [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Asteroid 132524 APL [ edit ] Asteroid 132524 APL viewed by New Horizons in June 2006 First images of Pluto in September 2006 Because of the need to conserve fuel for possible encounters with Kuiper belt objects subsequent to the Pluto flyby, intentional encounters with objects in the asteroid belt were not planned. After launch, the New Horizons team scanned the spacecraft's trajectory to determine if any asteroids would, by chance, be close enough for observation. In May 2006 it was discovered that New Horizons would pass close to the tiny asteroid 132524 APL on June 13, 2006. Closest approach occurred at 4:05 UTC at a distance of 101,867 km (63,297 mi) (around one quarter of the average Earth-Moon distance ). The asteroid was imaged by Ralph (use of LORRI was not possible because of proximity to the Sun), which gave the team a chance to test Ralph 's capabilities, and make observations of the asteroid's composition as well as light and phase curves. The asteroid was estimated to be 2.5 km (1.6 mi) in diameter. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] [ 109 ] The spacecraft successfully tracked the rapidly moving asteroid over June 10–12, 2006. First Pluto sighting [ edit ] The first images of Pluto from New Horizons were acquired September 21–24, 2006, during a test of LORRI. They were released on November 28, 2006. [ 110 ] The images, taken from a distance of approximately 4.2 billion km (2.6 billion mi; 28 AU), confirmed the spacecraft's ability to track distant targets, critical for maneuvering toward Pluto and other Kuiper belt objects. Jupiter encounter [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Jupiter Infrared image of Jupiter by New Horizons New Horizons used LORRI to take its first photographs of Jupiter on September 4, 2006, from a distance of 291 million kilometers (181 million miles). [ 111 ] More detailed exploration of the system began in January 2007 with an infrared image of the moon Callisto , as well as several black-and-white images of Jupiter itself. [ 112 ] New Horizons received a gravity assist from Jupiter, with its closest approach at 05:43:40 UTC on February 28, 2007, when it was 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Jupiter. The flyby increased New Horizons ' speed by 4 km/s (14,000 km/h; 9,000 mph), accelerating the probe to a velocity of 23 km/s (83,000 km/h; 51,000 mph) relative to the Sun and shortening its voyage to Pluto by three years. [ 113 ] The flyby was the center of a four-month intensive observation campaign lasting from January to June. Being an ever-changing scientific target, Jupiter has been observed intermittently since the end of the Galileo mission in September 2003. Knowledge about Jupiter benefited from the fact that New Horizons ' instruments were built using the latest technology, especially in the area of cameras, representing a significant improvement over Galileo 's cameras, which were modified versions of Voyager cameras, which, in turn, were modified Mariner cameras. The Jupiter encounter also served as a shakedown and dress rehearsal for the Pluto encounter. Because Jupiter is much closer to Earth than Pluto, the communications link can transmit multiple loadings of the memory buffer; thus the mission returned more data from the Jovian system than it was expected to transmit from Pluto. [ 114 ] One of the main goals during the Jupiter encounter was observing its atmospheric conditions and analyzing the structure and composition of its clouds. Heat-induced lightning strikes in the polar regions and "waves" that indicate violent storm activity were observed and measured. The Little Red Spot , spanning up to 70% of Earth's diameter, was imaged from up close for the first time. [ 113 ] Recording from different angles and illumination conditions, New Horizons took detailed images of Jupiter's faint ring system , discovering debris left over from recent collisions within the rings or from other unexplained phenomena. The search for undiscovered moons within the rings showed no results. Travelling through Jupiter's magnetosphere , New Horizons collected valuable particle readings. [ 113 ] "Bubbles" of plasma that are thought to be formed from material ejected by the moon Io were noticed in the magnetotail . [ 115 ] Jovian moons [ edit ] The four largest moons of Jupiter were in poor positions for observation; the necessary path of the gravity-assist maneuver meant that New Horizons passed millions of kilometers from any of the Galilean moons . Still, its instruments were intended for small, dim targets, so they were scientifically useful on large, distant moons. Emphasis was put on Jupiter's innermost Galilean moon, Io , whose active volcanoes shoot out tons of material into Jupiter's magnetosphere, and further. Out of eleven observed eruptions, three were seen for the first time. That of Tvashtar reached an altitude of up to 330 km (210 mi). The event gave scientists an unprecedented look into the structure and motion of the rising plume and its subsequent fall back to the surface. Infrared signatures of a further 36 volcanoes were noticed. [ 113 ] Callisto 's surface was analyzed with LEISA, revealing how lighting and viewing conditions affect infrared spectrum readings of its surface water ice. [ 116 ] Minor moons such as Amalthea had their orbit solutions refined. The cameras determined their positions, acting as "reverse optical navigation". Jovian moons imaged by New Horizons Io imaged on February 28, 2007. The feature near the north pole of the moon is a 290 km (180 mi) high plume from the volcano Tvashtar . Europa imaged on February 27, 2007, from a distance of 3.1 million km (1.9 million mi). Image scale is 15 km per pixel (9.3 mi/px). Ganymede imaged on February 27, 2007, from a distance of 3.5 million km (2.2 million mi). Image scale is 17 km per pixel (11 mi/px). Callisto imaged on February 27, 2007, from a distance of 4.7 million km (2.9 million mi).

After passing Jupiter, New Horizons spent most of its journey towards Pluto in hibernation mode. Redundant components as well as guidance and control systems were shut down to extend their life cycle, decrease operation costs and free the Deep Space Network for other missions. [ 117 ] During hibernation mode, the onboard computer monitored the probe's systems and transmitted a signal back to Earth; a "green" code if everything was functioning as expected or a "red" code if mission control's assistance was needed. [ 117 ] The probe was activated for about two months a year so that the instruments could be calibrated and the systems checked. The first hibernation mode cycle started on June 28, 2007, [ 117 ] the second cycle began on December 16, 2008, [ 118 ] the third cycle on August 27, 2009, [ 119 ] and the fourth cycle on August 29, 2014, after a 10-week test. [ 120 ] New Horizons crossed the orbit of Saturn on June 8, 2008, [ 121 ] and Uranus on March 18, 2011. [ 122 ] After astronomers announced the discovery of two new moons in the Pluto system, Kerberos and Styx , mission planners started contemplating the possibility of the probe running into unseen debris and dust left over from ancient collisions between the moons. A study based on 18 months of computer simulations, Earth-based telescope observations and occultations of the Pluto system revealed that the possibility of a catastrophic collision with debris or dust was less than 0.3% on the probe's scheduled course. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] If the hazard increased, New Horizons could have used one of two possible contingency plans, the so-called SHBOTs (Safe Haven by Other Trajectories). Either the probe could have continued on its present trajectory with the antenna facing the incoming particles so the more vital systems would be protected, or it could have positioned its antenna to make a course correction that would take it just 3,000 km (1,900 mi) from the surface of Pluto where it was expected that the atmospheric drag would have cleaned the surrounding space of possible debris. [ 124 ] While in hibernation mode in July 2012, New Horizons started gathering scientific data with SWAP, PEPSSI and VBSDC. Although it was originally planned to activate just the VBSDC, other instruments were powered on in order to collect valuable heliospheric data. Before activating the other two instruments, ground tests were conducted to make sure that the expanded data gathering in this phase of the mission would not limit available energy, memory and fuel in the future and that all systems were functioning during the flyby. [ 125 ] The first set of data was transmitted in January 2013 during a three-week activation from hibernation. The command and data handling software was updated to address the problem of computer resets. [ 126 ] Possible Neptune trojan targets [ edit ] Other possible targets were Neptune trojans . The probe's trajectory to Pluto passed near Neptune's trailing Lagrange point (" L 5 "), which may host hundreds of bodies in 1:1 resonance . In late 2013, New Horizons passed within 1.2 AU (180 million km; 110 million mi) of the high-inclination L5 Neptune trojan 2011 HM 102 , [ 127 ] which was discovered shortly before by the New Horizons KBO Search task, a survey to find additional distant objects for New Horizons to fly by after its 2015 encounter with Pluto. At that range, 2011 HM 102 would have been bright enough to be detectable by New Horizons ' LORRI instrument; however, the New Horizons team eventually decided that they would not target 2011 HM 102 for observations because the preparations for the Pluto approach took precedence. [ 128 ] On August 25, 2014, New Horizons crossed the orbit of Neptune , exactly 25 years after the planet was visited by the Voyager 2 probe. [ 129 ] This was the last major planet orbit crossing before the Pluto flyby. At the time, the spacecraft was 3.99 billion km (2.48 billion mi; 26.7 AU) away from Neptune and 4.51 billion km (2.80 billion mi; 30.1 AU) from the Sun. Observations of Pluto and Charon 2013–14 [ edit ] Images from July 1 to 3, 2013, by LORRI were the first by the probe to resolve Pluto and Charon as separate objects. [ 130 ] On July 14, 2014, mission controllers performed a sixth trajectory-correction maneuver (TCM) since its launch to enable the craft to reach Pluto. [ 131 ] Between July 19–24, 2014, New Horizons ' LORRI snapped 12 images of Charon revolving around Pluto, covering almost one full rotation at distances ranging from about 429 to 422 million km (267 to 262 million mi). [ 132 ] In August 2014, astronomers made high-precision measurements of Pluto's location and orbit around the Sun using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array ( ALMA ), an array of radio telescopes located in Chile, to help NASA's New Horizons spacecraft accurately home in on Pluto. [ 133 ] On December 6, 2014, mission controllers sent a signal for the craft to "wake up" from its final Pluto-approach hibernation and begin regular operations. The craft's response that it was "awake" reached Earth on December 7, 2014, at 02:30 UTC. [ 134 ] [ 135 ] [ 136 ] Pluto approach [ edit ] Pluto and Charon photographed on April 9, 2015, (left) by Ralph and on June 29, 2015, (right) by LORRI . Distant-encounter operations at Pluto began on January 4, 2015. [ 137 ] On this date, images of the targets with the onboard LORRI imager plus the Ralph telescope were only a few pixels in width. Investigators began taking Pluto images and background starfield images to assist mission navigators in the design of course-correcting engine maneuvers that would precisely modify the trajectory of New Horizons to aim the approach. [ 138 ] On February 12, 2015, NASA released new images of Pluto (taken from January 25 to 31) from the approaching probe. [ 139 ] [ 140 ] New Horizons was more than 203 million km (126 million mi) away from Pluto when it began taking the photos, which showed Pluto and its largest moon, Charon. The exposure time was too short to see Pluto's smaller, much fainter moons. Investigators compiled a series of images of the moons Nix and Hydra taken from January 27 through February 8, 2015, beginning at a range of 201 million km (125 million mi). [ 141 ] Pluto and Charon appear as a single overexposed object at the center. The right side image has been processed to remove the background starfield. The other two, even smaller moons—Kerberos and Styx—were seen on photos taken on April 25. [ 142 ] Starting on May 11, a hazard search was performed, looking for unknown objects that could be a danger to the spacecraft, such as rings or hitherto undiscovered moons, which could then possibly be avoided by a course change. [ 143 ] No rings or additional moons were found. Also in regard to the approach phase during January 2015, on August 21, 2012, the team announced that they would spend mission time attempting long-range observations of the Kuiper belt object temporarily designated VNH0004 (now designated 2011 KW 48 ), when the object was at a distance of 75 million km (0.50 AU; 47 million mi) from New Horizons . [ 144 ] The object would be too distant to resolve surface features or take spectroscopy, but it would be able to make observations that cannot be made from Earth, namely a phase curve and a search for small moons. A second object was planned to be observed in June 2015, and a third in September after the flyby; the team hoped to observe a dozen such objects through 2018. [ 144 ] On April 15, 2015, Pluto was imaged showing a possible polar cap. [ 145 ] Software glitch [ edit ] On July 4, 2015, New Horizons experienced a software anomaly and went into safe mode, preventing the spacecraft from performing scientific observations until engineers could resolve the problem. [ 146 ] [ 147 ] On July 5, NASA announced that the problem was determined to be a timing flaw in a command sequence used to prepare the spacecraft for its flyby, and the spacecraft would resume scheduled science operations on July 7. The science observations lost because of the anomaly were judged to have no impact on the mission's main objectives and minimal impact on other objectives. [ 148 ] The timing flaw consisted of performing two tasks simultaneously—compressing previously acquired data to release space for more data, and making a second copy of the approach command sequence—that together overloaded the spacecraft's primary computer. After the overload was detected, the spacecraft performed as designed: it switched from the primary computer to the backup computer, entered safe mode, and sent a distress call back to Earth. The distress call was received the afternoon of July 4 and alerted engineers that they needed to contact the spacecraft to get more information and resolve the issue. The resolution was that the problem happened as part of preparations for the approach, and was not expected to happen again because no similar tasks were planned for the remainder of the encounter. [ 148 ] [ 149 ] Pluto system encounter [ edit ] Alan Stern and the New Horizons team celebrate after the spacecraft successfully completed its flyby of Pluto. The closest approach of the New Horizons spacecraft to Pluto occurred at 11:49 UTC on July 14, 2015, at a range of 12,472 km (7,750 mi) from the surface [ 150 ] and 13,658 km (8,487 mi) from the center of Pluto. Telemetry data confirming a successful flyby and a healthy spacecraft was received on Earth from the vicinity of the Pluto system on July 15, 2015, 00:52:37 UTC, [ 151 ] after 22 hours of planned radio silence due to the spacecraft being pointed towards the Pluto system . Mission managers estimated a one in 10,000 chance that debris could have destroyed the probe or its communication-systems during the flyby, preventing it from sending data to Earth. [ 152 ] The first details of the encounter were received the next day, but the download of the complete data set through the 2 kbps data downlink took just over 15 months. [ 19 ] Objectives [ edit ] The mission's science objectives were grouped in three distinct priorities. The "primary objectives" were required. The "secondary objectives" were expected to be met but were not demanded. The "tertiary objectives" were desired. These objectives could have been skipped in favor of the above objectives. An objective to measure any magnetic field of Pluto was dropped, due to mass and the expense associated with including a magnetometer on the spacecraft. Instead, SWAP and PEPSSI could indirectly detect magnetic fields around Pluto. [ 153 ] Primary objectives (required) Characterize the global geology and morphology of Pluto and Charon Map chemical compositions of Pluto and Charon surfaces Characterize the neutral (non- ionized ) atmosphere of Pluto and its escape rate Secondary objectives (expected) Characterize the time variability of Pluto's surface and atmosphere Image select Pluto and Charon areas in stereo Map the terminators (day/night border) of Pluto and Charon with high resolution Map the chemical compositions of select Pluto and Charon areas with high resolution Characterize Pluto's ionosphere (upper layer of the atmosphere) and its interaction with the solar wind Search for molecular neutral species such as molecular hydrogen , hydrocarbons , hydrogen cyanide and other nitriles in the atmosphere Search for any Charon atmosphere Determine bolometric Bond albedos for Pluto and Charon Map surface temperatures of Pluto and Charon Map any additional surfaces of outermost moons: Nix , Hydra , Kerberos , and Styx Tertiary objectives (desired) Characterize the energetic particle environment at Pluto and Charon Refine bulk parameters (radii, masses) and orbits of Pluto and Charon Search for additional moons and any rings "The New Horizons flyby of the Pluto system was fully successful, meeting and in many cases exceeding, the Pluto objectives set out for it by NASA and the National Academy of Sciences."

On July 14, 2015, at 11:50 UTC, New Horizons made its closest approach to Pluto, passing within 12,500 km (7,800 mi) at a speed of 13.78 km/s (49,600 km/h; 30,800 mph), while also coming as close as 28,800 km (17,900 mi) to Charon. Starting 3.2 days prior, the spacecraft mapped Pluto and Charon with 40 km (25 mi) resolution, enabling coverage of all sides. Close-range imaging was conducted twice daily to monitor for surface changes, such as snowfall or cryovolcanism . During the flyby, LORRI captured images with up to 50 m (160 ft) resolution, MVIC created four-color global maps at 1.6 km (1 mi) resolution, and LEISA obtained near-infrared hyperspectral maps at resolutions ranging from 7 km/px (4.3 mi/px) globally to 0.6 km/px (0.37 mi/px) for selected areas. Patterns of blue-gray ridges and reddish material observed in the Tartarus Dorsa region on July 14, 2015 Meanwhile, Alice characterized the atmosphere, both by emissions of atmospheric molecules ( airglow ), and by dimming of background stars as they pass behind Pluto ( occultation ). During and after closest approach, SWAP and PEPSSI sampled the high atmosphere and its effects on the solar wind. VBSDC searched for dust, inferring meteoroid collision rates and any invisible rings. REX performed active and passive radio science. The communications dish on Earth measured the disappearance and reappearance of the radio occultation signal as the probe flew by behind Pluto. The results resolved Pluto's diameter (by their timing) and atmospheric density and composition (by their weakening and strengthening pattern). (Alice can perform similar occultations, using sunlight instead of radio beacons.) Previous missions had the spacecraft transmit through the atmosphere, to Earth ("downlink"). Pluto's mass and mass distribution were evaluated by the gravitational tug on the spacecraft. As the spacecraft speeds up and slows down, the radio signal exhibited a Doppler shift . The Doppler shift was measured by comparison with the ultrastable oscillator in the communications electronics. Reflected sunlight from Charon allowed some imaging observations of the nightside. Backlighting by the Sun gave an opportunity to highlight any rings or atmospheric hazes. REX performed radiometry of the nightside. Satellite observations [ edit ] New Horizons ' best spatial resolution of the small satellites is 330 m per pixel (1,080 ft/px) at Nix, 780 m/px (2,560 ft/px) at Hydra, and approximately 1.8 km/px (1.1 mi/px) at Kerberos and Styx. Estimates for the dimensions of these bodies are: Nix at 49.8 × 33.2 × 31.1 km (30.9 × 20.6 × 19.3 mi); Hydra at 50.9 × 36.1 × 30.9 km (31.6 × 22.4 × 19.2 mi); Kerberos at 19 × 10 × 9 km (11.8 × 6.2 × 5.6 mi); and Styx at 16 × 9 × 8 km (9.9 × 5.6 × 5.0 mi). [ 155 ] Initial predictions envisioned Kerberos as a relatively large and massive object whose dark surface led to it having a faint reflection. This proved to be wrong as images obtained by New Horizons on July 14 and sent back to Earth in October 2015 revealed that Kerberos was smaller in size, 19 km (12 mi) across with a highly reflective surface suggesting the presence of relatively clean water ice similarly to the rest of Pluto's smaller moons. [ 156 ] Satellites of Pluto imaged by New Horizons Charon Styx Nix Kerberos Hydra Media related to Photos of Pluto system by New Horizons at Wikimedia Commons Post-Pluto events [ edit ] View of Pluto as New Horizons left the system, catching the Sun's rays passing through Pluto's atmosphere, forming a ring Soon after the Pluto flyby, in July 2015, New Horizons reported that the spacecraft was healthy, its flight path was within the margins, and science data of the Pluto–Charon system had been recorded. [ 157 ] [ 158 ] The spacecraft's immediate task was to begin returning the 6.25 gigabytes of information collected. [ 19 ] The free-space path loss at its distance of 4.5 light-hours (3 billion km or 20 AU or 1.9 billion mi) is approximately 303 dB at 7 GHz. Using the high gain antenna and transmitting at full power, the signal from EIRP is +83 dBm, and at this distance, the signal reaching Earth is −220 dBm. The received signal level (RSL) using one, un-arrayed Deep Space Network antenna with 72 dBi of forward gain equals −148 dBm. [ 159 ] Because of the extremely low RSL, it could only transmit data at 1 to 2 kilobits per second . [ 160 ] By March 30, 2016, about nine months after the flyby, New Horizons reached the halfway point of transmitting this data. [ 161 ] The transfer was completed on October 25, 2016, at 21:48 UTC, when the last piece of data—part of a Pluto–Charon observation sequence by the Ralph/LEISA imager—was received by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory . [ 19 ] [ 162 ] As of November 2018, at a distance of 43 AU (6.43 billion km; 4.00 billion mi) from the Sun and 0.4 AU (60 million km; 37 million mi) from 486958 Arrokoth, [ 163 ] New Horizons was heading in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius [ 164 ] at 14.10 km/s (8.76 mi/s ; 2.97 AU/a ) relative to the Sun. [ 163 ] The brightness of the Sun from the spacecraft was magnitude −18.5. [ 164 ] On April 17, 2021, New Horizons reached a distance of 50 AU from the Sun, while remaining fully operational. [ 165 ] Mission extension [ edit ] Big picture: from the inner Solar System to the Oort cloud with the Kuiper belt in between The New Horizons team requested, and received, a mission extension through 2021 to explore additional Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). Funding was secured on July 1, 2016. [ 166 ] During this Kuiper Belt Extended Mission (KEM) the spacecraft performed a close fly-by of 486958 Arrokoth and will conduct more distant observations of an additional two dozen objects, [ 167 ] [ 166 ] [ 168 ] and possibly make a fly-by of another KBO. [ citation needed ] Kuiper belt object mission [ edit ] Target background [ edit ] Mission planners searched for one or more additional Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) of the order of 50–100 km (30–60 mi) in diameter as targets for flybys similar to the spacecraft's Plutonian encounter. However, despite the large population of KBOs, many factors limited the number of possible targets. Because the flight path was determined by the Pluto flyby, and the probe only had 33 kg (73 lb) of hydrazine propellant remaining, the object to be visited needed to be within a cone of less than a degree's width extending from Pluto. The target also needed to be within 55 AU, because beyond 55 AU, the communications link becomes too weak, and the RTG power output decays significantly enough to hinder observations. [ 169 ] Desirable KBOs are well over 50 km (30 mi) in diameter, neutral in color (to contrast with the reddish Pluto), and, if possible, have a moon that imparts a wobble. [ citation needed ] KBO Search [ edit ] Trajectory of New Horizons and other nearby Kuiper belt objects In 2011, mission scientists started the New Horizons KBO Search , a dedicated survey for suitable KBOs using ground telescopes. Large ground telescopes with wide-field cameras, notably the twin 6.5-meter Magellan Telescopes in Chile, the 8.2-meter Subaru Observatory in Hawaii and the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope [ 127 ] [ 170 ] were used to search for potential targets. By participating in a citizen-science project called Ice Hunters the public helped to scan telescopic images for possible suitable mission candidates. [ 171 ] [ 172 ] [ 173 ] [ 174 ] [ 175 ] The ground-based search resulted in the discovery of about 143 KBOs of potential interest, [ 176 ] but none of these were close enough to the flight path of New Horizons . [ 170 ] Only the Hubble Space Telescope was deemed likely to find a suitable target in time for a successful KBO mission. [ 177 ] On June 16, 2014, time on Hubble was granted for a search. [ 178 ] Hubble has a much greater ability to find suitable KBOs than ground telescopes. The probability that a target for New Horizons would be found was estimated beforehand at about 95%. [ 179 ] Suitable KBOs [ edit ] 486958 Arrokoth, the announced target for the Kuiper belt object mission On October 15, 2014, it was revealed that Hubble's search had uncovered three potential targets, [ 180 ] [ 181 ] [ 182 ] [ 183 ] [ 184 ] temporarily designated PT1 ("potential target 1"), PT2 and PT3 by the New Horizons team. PT1 was eventually chosen as the target and would be named 486958 Arrokoth . All objects had estimated diameters in the 30–55 km (19–34 mi) range and were too small to be seen by ground telescopes. The targets were at distances from the Sun ranging from 43 to 44 AU, which would put the encounters in the 2018–2019 period. [ 181 ] The initial estimated probabilities that these objects were reachable within New Horizons ' fuel budget were 100%, 7%, and 97%, respectively. [ 181 ] All were members of the "cold" (low- inclination , low- eccentricity ) classical Kuiper belt objects, and thus were very different from Pluto. PT1 (given the temporary designation "1110113Y" on the HST web site [ 185 ] ), the most favorably situated object, had a magnitude of 26.8, is 30–45 km (19–28 mi) in diameter, and was encountered in January 2019. [ 186 ] A course change to reach it required about 35% of New Horizons ' available trajectory-adjustment fuel supply .  A mission to PT3 was in some ways preferable, in that it is brighter and therefore probably larger than PT1, but the greater fuel requirements to reach it would have left less for maneuvering and unforeseen events. [ 181 ] Once sufficient orbital information was provided, the Minor Planet Center gave provisional designations to the three target KBOs: 2014 MU 69 (PT1' later 486958 Arrokoth), 2014 OS 393 (PT2), and 2014 PN 70 (PT3). By the fall of 2014, a possible fourth target, 2014 MT 69 , had been eliminated by follow-up observations. PT2 was out of the running before the Pluto flyby. [ 187 ] [ 188 ] KBO selection [ edit ] On August 28, 2015, 486958 Arrokoth (then known as (486958) 2014 MU 69 and nicknamed Ultima Thule ) (PT1) was chosen as the flyby target. The necessary course adjustment was performed with four engine firings between October 22 and November 4, 2015. [ 189 ] [ 190 ] The flyby occurred on January 1, 2019, at 00:33 UTC. [ 191 ] [ 192 ] Observations of other KBOs [ edit ] Aside from its flyby of 486958 Arrokoth, the extended mission for New Horizons calls for the spacecraft to conduct observations of, and look for ring systems around, between 25 and 35 different KBOs. [ 193 ] In addition, it will continue to study the gas, dust and plasma composition of the Kuiper belt before the mission extension ends in 2021. [ 167 ] [ 168 ] [ needs update ] On November 2, 2015, New Horizons imaged KBO 15810 Arawn with the LORRI instrument from 280 million km away (170 million mi; 1.9 AU). [ 194 ] This KBO was again imaged by the LORRI instrument on April 7–8, 2016, from a distance of 111 million km (69 million mi; 0.74 AU). The new images allowed the science team to further refine the location of 15810 Arawn to within 1,000 km (620 mi) and to determine its rotational period of 5.47 hours. [ 195 ] [ 196 ] In July 2016, the LORRI camera captured some distant images of Quaoar from 2.1 billion km away (1.3 billion mi; 14 AU); the oblique view will complement Earth-based observations to study the object's light-scattering properties. [ 197 ] On December 5, 2017, when New Horizons was 40.9 AU from Earth, a calibration image of the Wishing Well cluster marked the most distant image ever taken by a spacecraft (breaking the 27-year record set by Voyager 1 ' s famous Pale Blue Dot ). Two hours later, New Horizons surpassed its own record, imaging the Kuiper belt objects 2012 HZ 84 and 2012 HE 85 from a distance of 0.50 and 0.34 AU, respectively. These were the closest images taken of a Kuiper belt object besides Pluto and Arrokoth as of February 2018 [update] . [ 198 ] [ 199 ] The dwarf planet Haumea was observed from afar by the New Horizons spacecraft in October 2007, January 2017, and May 2020, from distances of 49 AU, 59 AU, and 63 AU, respectively. New Horizons has observed the dwarf planets Eris (2020), Haumea (2007, 2017, 2020), Makemake (2007, 2017), and Quaoar (2016, 2017, 2019), as well as the large KBOs Ixion (2016), Máni (2016, 2017, 2019), and 2014 OE 394 (2017, 2018). It also observed Neptune's largest moon Triton (which shares similarities with Pluto and Eris) in 2019.

In addition, since 2021, Canadian researchers had been able to use machine learning software to speed up identification processes of potential KBO targets for a third flyby, cutting weeks-long efforts to hours-long. [ 200 ] [ 201 ] Encounter with Arrokoth [ edit ] Animation of New Horizons' flyby of Arrokoth in Eyes on the Solar System .

Searches will be conducted for orbiting moonlets, a coma, rings and the surrounding environment. [ 204 ] Additional objectives include: [ 205 ] Mapping the surface geology to learn how it formed and evolved Measuring the surface temperature Mapping the 3-D surface topography and surface composition to learn how it is similar to and different from comets such as 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko and dwarf planets such as Pluto Searching for any signs of activity, such as a cloud-like coma Searching for and studying any satellites or rings Measuring or constraining the mass Targeting maneuvers [ edit ] Arrokoth is the first object to be targeted for a flyby that was discovered after the spacecraft was launched. [ 206 ] New Horizons was planned to come within 3,500 km (2,200 mi) of Arrokoth, three times closer than the spacecraft's earlier encounter with Pluto. Images with a resolution of up to 30 m (98 ft) per pixel were expected. [ 207 ] The new mission began on October 22, 2015, when New Horizons carried out the first in a series of four initial targeting maneuvers designed to send it towards Arrokoth. The maneuver, which started at approximately 19:50 UTC and used two of the spacecraft's small hydrazine-fueled thrusters, lasted approximately 16 minutes and changed the spacecraft's trajectory by about 10 meters per second (33 ft/s). The remaining three targeting maneuvers took place on October 25, October 28, and November 4, 2015. [ 208 ] [ 209 ] Approach phase [ edit ] The craft was brought out of its hibernation at approximately 00:33 UTC SCET on June 5, 2018 (06:12 UTC ERT , Earth-Received Time), [ a ] in order to prepare for the approach phase. [ 211 ] [ 212 ] After verifying its health status, the spacecraft transitioned from a spin-stabilized mode to a three-axis-stabilized mode on August 13, 2018. The official approach phase began on August 16, 2018, and continued through December 24, 2018. [ 213 ] New Horizons made its first detection of Arrokoth on August 16, 2018, from a distance of 172 million km (107 million mi). At that time, Arrokoth was visible at magnitude 20 against a crowded stellar background in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius . [ 214 ] [ 215 ] Flyby [ edit ] The Core phase began a week before the encounter and continued for two days after the encounter. The spacecraft flew by the object at a speed of 51,500 km/h (32,000 mph; 14.3 km/s) and within 3,500 km (2,200 mi). [ 216 ] The majority of the science data was collected within 48 hours of the closest approach in a phase called the Inner Core. [ 213 ] Closest approach occurred January 1, 2019, at 05:33 UTC [ 217 ] SCET at which point the probe was 43.4 AU from the Sun . [ 218 ] At this distance, the one-way transit time for radio signals between Earth and New Horizons was six hours. [ 204 ] Confirmation that the craft had succeeded in filling its digital recorders occurred when data arrived on Earth ten hours later, at 15:29 UTC. [ 219 ] Data download [ edit ] After the encounter, preliminary, high-priority data was sent to Earth on January 1 and 2, 2019. On January 9, New Horizons returned to a spin-stabilized mode to prepare sending the remainder of its data back to Earth. [ 213 ] This download was expected to take 20 months at a data rate of 1–2 kilobits per second . [ 220 ] As of July 2022, approximately 10% of the data was still left to be received. [ 221 ] Post-Arrokoth events [ edit ] Parallax of Proxima Centauri as observed from New Horizons and Earth. [ 222 ] In April 2020, New Horizons was used in conjunction with telescopes on Earth to take pictures of nearby stars Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359 ; the images from each vantage point – over 6.4 billion km (4 billion miles) apart – were compared to produce "the first demonstration of an easily observable stellar parallax ." [ 222 ] Images taken by the LORRI camera while New Horizons was 42 to 45 AU from the Sun were used to measure the cosmic optical background, the visible light analog of the cosmic microwave background , in seven high galactic latitude fields. At that distance New Horizons saw a sky ten times darker than the sky seen by the Hubble Space Telescope because of the absence of diffuse background sky brightness from the zodiacal light in the inner solar system. These measurements indicate that the total amount of light emitted by all galaxies at ultraviolet and visible wavelengths may be lower than previously thought. [ 223 ] [ 224 ] New Horizons ' position [ 163 ] The spacecraft reached a distance of 50 AU (7.5 billion km; 4.6 billion mi) on April 17, 2021, at 12:42 UTC, a feat performed only four times before, by Pioneer 10 , Pioneer 11 , Voyager 1 , and Voyager 2 . Voyager 1 is the farthest spacecraft from the Sun, more than 152 AU (22.7 billion km; 14.1 billion mi) away when New Horizons reached its landmark in 2021. [ 165 ] The support team continued to use the spacecraft in 2021 to study the heliospheric environment (plasma, dust and gas) and to study other Kuiper Belt objects. [ 225 ] The All-sky New Horizons Alice Lyα maps in ecliptic coordinates centered on the anti-Sun direction, and the lower map is in Galactic coordinates. The ~90,000 stars in the M. A. Velez et al. (2024) catalog are overlaid as black dots, where the size of the dot is proportional to the logarithm of the expected Alice count rate from each star. The map in Galactic coordinates indicates the outlines of four of the important LISM clouds ("LIC," in red; "Aql," in green; "Blue," in blue; and "G," in tan). [ 226 ] In 2025, the first map of all Lyman-Alpha emissions in the Milky Way galaxy was published, based on New Horizons observations. [ 226 ] Plans [ edit ] After the spacecraft passed Arrokoth, the instruments continue to have enough power to be operational until the 2030s. Team leader Alan Stern stated there is potential for a third flyby in the 2020s at the outer edges of the Kuiper belt. [ 227 ] [ 228 ] This depends on a suitable Kuiper belt object being found or confirmed close enough to the spacecraft's current trajectory. Since May 2020, the New Horizons team has been using time on the Subaru Telescope to look for suitable candidates within the spacecraft's proximity. As of June 2024, no suitable targets had been found. Beginning in fiscal year 2025, it was planned for New Horizons to focus on specific heliophysics data, as stated by NASA in September 2023. It will remain available for a flyby of a different target until it leaves the Kuiper belt in 2028. [ 229 ] New Horizons may also take a picture of Earth from its distance in the Kuiper belt, but only after completing all planned KBO flybys and imaging Uranus and Neptune. [ 230 ] [ 231 ] This is because pointing a camera towards Earth could cause the camera to be damaged by sunlight, [ 232 ] as none of New Horizons' cameras have an active shutter mechanism. [ 233 ] [ 234 ] Speed [ edit ] Speed and distance from the Sun New Horizons has been called "the fastest spacecraft ever launched" [ 8 ] because it left Earth at 16.26 kilometers per second (58,536 km/h; 36,373 mph). [ 9 ] [ 10 ] It is also the first spacecraft launched directly into a solar escape trajectory, which requires an approximate speed while near Earth of 16.5 km/s (59,000 km/h; 37,000 mph), [ b ] plus additional delta- v to cover air and gravity drag , all to be provided by the launch vehicle. As of May 2, 2024, the spacecraft is 58.80 AU (8.796 billion km; 5.466 billion mi) from the Sun traveling at 13.68 kilometres per second (49,200 km/h; 30,600 mph). [ 235 ] However, it is not the fastest spacecraft to leave the Solar System. As of July 2023 [update] , this record is held by Voyager 1 , traveling at 16.985 km/s (61,146 km/h; 37,994 mph) relative to the Sun. [ 164 ] Voyager 1 attained greater hyperbolic excess velocity than New Horizons due to gravity assists by Jupiter and Saturn.  When New Horizons reaches the distance of 100 AU (15 billion km; 9.3 billion mi), it will be traveling at about 13 km/s (47,000 km/h; 29,000 mph), around 4 km/s (14,000 km/h; 8,900 mph) slower than Voyager 1 at that distance. [ 236 ] The Parker Solar Probe can also be measured as the fastest object, because of its orbital speed relative to the Sun at perihelion : 191 km/s (690,000 km/h; 430,000 mph). [ 237 ] [ c ] Because it remains in solar orbit, its specific orbital energy relative to the Sun is lower than New Horizons and other artificial objects escaping the Solar System . New Horizons ' Star 48B third stage is also on a hyperbolic escape trajectory from the Solar System and reached Jupiter before the New Horizons spacecraft; it was expected to cross Pluto's orbit on October 15, 2015. [ 239 ] Because it was not in controlled flight, it did not receive the correct gravity assist and passed within 200 million km (120 million mi) of Pluto. [ 239 ] The Centaur second stage did not achieve solar escape velocity and remains in a heliocentric orbit.

Spacecraft Event Time is calculated by subtracting the one-way light-travel time (5 hours, 38 minutes, 38 seconds) from Earth-received time. [ 210 ] ^ To escape the Sun, the spacecraft needs a speed relative to the Sun of the square root of 2 times the speed of the Earth, which is 29.78 km/s. (In other words, 2 ⋅ 29.78 km/s ≈ 42.11 km/s {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}\cdot 29.78{\text{ km/s}}\approx 42.11{\text{ km/s}}} .) Relative to the Earth, this is just 12.3 km/s. But the kinetic energy when near the surface of the Earth must include the energy to exit the gravity well of the Earth, which requires a speed of about 11 km/s. The total speed needed is the square root of the sum of the squares of these two speeds. [ citation needed ] ^ The Parker Solar Probe is expected to beat this record at its next perihelion in April 2019. [ needs update ] Following several more gravity assists at Venus, the spacecraft has reached a maximum speed at perihelion of approximately 192 km/s (690,000 km/h; 430,000 mph) on March 22, 2025.

The Flagship -class robotic spacecraft comprised both NASA's Cassini space probe and ESA's Huygens lander , which landed on Saturn's largest moon, Titan . [ 9 ] Cassini was the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter its orbit, where it stayed from 2004 to 2017. The two craft took their names from the astronomers Giovanni Cassini and Christiaan Huygens . Launched aboard a Titan IVB/Centaur on October 15, 1997, Cassini was active in space for nearly 20 years, spending almost 7 years in transit and 13 years orbiting Saturn, studying the planet and its system after entering orbit on July 1, 2004. [ 10 ] The voyage to Saturn included flybys of Venus (April 1998 and July 1999), Earth (August 1999), the asteroid 2685 Masursky , and Jupiter (December 2000). The mission ended on September 15, 2017, when Cassini ' s trajectory took it into Saturn's upper atmosphere and it burned up [ 11 ] [ 12 ] in order to prevent any risk of contaminating Saturn's moons, which might have offered habitable environments to stowaway terrestrial microbes on the spacecraft. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The mission was successful beyond expectations – NASA's Planetary Science Division Director, Jim Green , described Cassini–Huygens as a "mission of firsts" [ 15 ] that revolutionized human understanding of the Saturn system, including its moons and rings, and our understanding of where life might be found in the Solar System . [ 16 ] Overview [ edit ] Planning and development [ edit ] Scientists and individuals from 27 countries made up the joint team responsible for designing, building, flying and collecting data from the Cassini orbiter and the Huygens probe . [ 16 ] Cassini ' s planners originally scheduled a mission of four years, from June 2004 to May 2008. The mission was extended for another two years until September 2010, branded the Cassini Equinox Mission . The mission was extended a second and final time with the Cassini Solstice Mission , lasting another seven years until September 15, 2017, on which date Cassini was de-orbited to burn up in Saturn's upper atmosphere. [ 17 ] The Huygens module traveled with Cassini until its separation from the probe on December 25, 2004; Huygens landed by parachute . [ 18 ] on Titan on January 14, 2005.  The separation was facilitated by the SED (Spin/Eject device), which provided a relative separation speed of 0.35 metres per second (1.1 ft/s) and a spin rate of 7.5 rpm. [ 19 ] It returned data to Earth for around 90 minutes, using the orbiter as a relay. This was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer Solar System and the first landing on a moon other than Earth's Moon. At the end of its mission, the Cassini spacecraft executed its "Grand Finale": a number of risky passes through the gaps between Saturn and its inner rings. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] This phase aimed to maximize Cassini 's scientific outcome before the spacecraft was intentionally destroyed [ 20 ] to prevent potential contamination of Saturn's moons if Cassini were to unintentionally crash into them when maneuvering the probe was no longer possible due to power loss or other communication issues at the end of its operational lifespan. Cassini's atmospheric entry on Saturn ended the mission, but analysis of the returned data will continue for many years. [ 16 ] NASA and JPL [ edit ] NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , where the orbiter was assembled, managed the mission. The European Space Research and Technology Centre developed Huygens . The centre's prime contractor, Aérospatiale of France (which became part of Thales Alenia Space in 2005), assembled the probe with equipment and instruments supplied by many European countries (including Huygens 's batteries and two scientific instruments from the United States). The Italian Space Agency (ASI) provided the Cassini orbiter's high-gain radio antenna , with the incorporation of a low-gain antenna (to ensure telecommunications with the Earth for the entire duration of the mission), a compact and lightweight radar , which also used the high-gain antenna and served as a synthetic-aperture radar , a radar altimeter , a radiometer , the radio science subsystem (RSS), and the visible -channel portion VIMS-V of VIMS spectrometer . [ 21 ] NASA provided the VIMS infrared counterpart, as well as the Main Electronic Assembly, which included electronic sub-assemblies provided by CNES of France. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] On April 16, 2008, NASA announced a two-year extension of the funding for ground operations of this mission, at which point it was renamed the Cassini Equinox Mission. [ 24 ] It was extended again in February 2010 as the Cassini Solstice Mission . Naming [ edit ] The mission consisted of two main elements: the ASI/NASA Cassini orbiter, named for the Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini , the discoverer of Saturn's ring divisions and four of its satellites; and the ESA-developed Huygens probe , named for the Dutch astronomer, mathematician and physicist Christiaan Huygens , discoverer of Titan. The mission was commonly called Saturn Orbiter Titan Probe (SOTP) during gestation, both as a Mariner Mark II mission and generically. [ 25 ] Cassini–Huygens was a Flagship -class mission to the outer planets. [ 9 ] The other planetary flagships include Galileo , Voyager , and Viking . [ 9 ] Objectives [ edit ] Cassini had several objectives, including: [ 26 ] Determining the three-dimensional structure and dynamic behavior of the rings of Saturn . Determining the composition of the satellite surfaces and the geological history of each object. Determining the nature and origin of the dark material on Iapetus 's leading hemisphere. Measuring the three-dimensional structure and dynamic behavior of the magnetosphere . Studying the dynamic behavior of Saturn's atmosphere at cloud level. Studying the time variability of Titan's clouds and hazes . Characterizing Titan's surface on a regional scale. Cassini–Huygens was launched on October 15, 1997, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station 's Space Launch Complex 40 using a U.S. Air Force Titan IVB / Centaur rocket. The complete launcher was made up of a two-stage Titan IV booster rocket , two strap-on solid rocket engines , the Centaur upper stage, and a payload enclosure, or fairing. [ 27 ] The total cost of this scientific exploration mission was about US$3.26 billion , including $1.4 billion for pre-launch development, $704 million for mission operations, $54 million for tracking and $422 million for the launch vehicle . The United States contributed $2.6 billion (80%), the ESA $500 million (15%), and the ASI $160 million (5%). [ 28 ] However, these figures are from the press kit which was prepared in October 2000. They do not include inflation over the course of a very long mission, nor do they include the cost of the extended missions. The primary mission for Cassini was completed on July 30, 2008. The mission was extended to June 2010 ( Cassini Equinox Mission). [ 29 ] This studied the Saturn system in detail during the planet's equinox , which happened in August 2009. [ 24 ] On February 3, 2010, NASA announced another extension for Cassini , lasting 6 1 ⁄ 2 years until 2017, ending at the time of summer solstice in Saturn's northern hemisphere ( Cassini Solstice Mission). The extension enabled another 155 revolutions around the planet, 54 flybys of Titan and 11 flybys of Enceladus . [ 30 ] In 2017, an encounter with Titan changed its orbit in such a way that, at closest approach to Saturn, it was only 3,000 km (1,900 mi) above the planet's cloudtops, below the inner edge of the D ring . This sequence of "proximal orbits" ended when its final encounter with Titan sent the probe into Saturn's atmosphere to be destroyed. Destinations [ edit ] Selected destinations (ordered largest to smallest but not to scale) Titan Earth's Moon Rhea Iapetus Dione Tethys Enceladus Mimas Hyperion Phoebe Janus Epimetheus Prometheus Pandora Helene Atlas Pan Telesto Calypso Methone History [ edit ] Huygens's explanation for the aspects of Saturn, Systema Saturnium (1659) A Titan IV-B rocket and Centaur-T upper stage with the Cassini–Huygens payload at LC-40 , three days before its 15 October 1997 launch Cassini–Huygens ' s origins date to 1982, when the European Science Foundation and the American National Academy of Sciences formed a working group to investigate future cooperative missions. Two European scientists suggested a paired Saturn Orbiter and Titan Probe as a possible joint mission. In 1983, NASA's Solar System Exploration Committee recommended the same Orbiter and Probe pair as a core NASA project. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) performed a joint study of the potential mission from 1984 to 1985. ESA continued with its own study in 1986, while the American astronaut Sally Ride , in her influential 1987 report NASA Leadership and America's Future in Space , also examined and approved of the Cassini mission. [ 31 ] While Ride's report described the Saturn orbiter and probe as a NASA solo mission, in 1988 the Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications of NASA, Len Fisk, returned to the idea of a joint NASA and ESA mission. He wrote to his counterpart at ESA, Roger Bonnet, strongly suggesting that ESA choose the Cassini mission from the three candidates at hand and promising that NASA would commit to the mission as soon as ESA did. [ 32 ] At the time, NASA was becoming more sensitive to the strain that had developed between the American and European space programs as a result of European perceptions that NASA had not treated it like an equal during previous collaborations. NASA officials and advisers involved in promoting and planning Cassini–Huygens attempted to correct this trend by stressing their desire to evenly share any scientific and technology benefits resulting from the mission. In part, this newfound spirit of cooperation with Europe was driven by a sense of competition with the Soviet Union , which had begun to cooperate more closely with Europe as ESA drew further away from NASA. Late in 1988, ESA chose Cassini–Huygens as its next major mission and the following year the program received major funding in the US. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] The collaboration not only improved relations between the two space programs but also helped Cassini–Huygens survive congressional budget cuts in the United States. Cassini–Huygens came under fire politically in both 1992 and 1994, but NASA successfully persuaded the United States Congress that it would be unwise to halt the project after ESA had already poured funds into development because frustration on broken space exploration promises might spill over into other areas of foreign relations. The project proceeded politically smoothly after 1994, although citizens' groups concerned about the potential environmental impact a launch failure might have (because of its plutonium power source) attempted to derail it through protests and lawsuits until and past its 1997 launch. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Spacecraft design [ edit ] Diagram of Cassini Cassini–Huygens assembly Cassini–Huygens original design ( Mariner Mark II , 1988) The spacecraft was planned to be the second three-axis stabilized, RTG -powered Mariner Mark II , a class of spacecraft developed for missions beyond the orbit of Mars , after the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) mission, but budget cuts and project rescopings forced NASA to terminate CRAF development to save Cassini . As a result, Cassini became more specialized. The Mariner Mark II series was cancelled. The combined orbiter and probe was at the time the third-largest uncrewed interplanetary spacecraft ever successfully launched, behind the Phobos 1 and 2 Mars probes, as well as being among the most complex; [ 40 ] [ 41 ] NASA's Europa Clipper became the new third-largest probe upon its launch in 2024. [ 42 ] The orbiter had a mass of 2,150 kg (4,740 lb), the probe 350 kg (770 lb) including 30 kg (66 lb) of probe support equipment left on the orbiter. With the launch vehicle adapter and 3,132 kg (6,905 lb) of propellants at launch, the spacecraft had a mass of 5,600 kg (12,300 lb). The Cassini spacecraft was 6.8 meters (22 ft) high and 4 meters (13 ft) wide. Its bus was a dodecagonal prism atop a conical frustum connecting it to a cylinder containing the propellant tanks, to which the RTGs and Huygens were attached. [ 43 ] Spacecraft complexity was increased by its trajectory (flight path) to Saturn, and by the ambitious science at its destination. Cassini had 1,630 interconnected electronic components , 22,000 wire connections, and 14 kilometers (8.7 mi) of cabling. [ 44 ] The core control computer CPU was a redundant system using the MIL-STD-1750A instruction set architecture . The main propulsion system consisted of one prime and one backup R-4D bipropellant rocket engine. The thrust of each engine was 490 N (110 lbf ) and the total spacecraft delta-v was 2,352 m/s (5,260 mph). [ 45 ] Smaller monopropellant rockets provided attitude control. Cassini was powered by 32.7 kg (72 lb) of nuclear fuel, mainly plutonium dioxide (containing 28.3 kg (62 lb) of pure plutonium ). [ 46 ] The heat from the material's radioactive decay was turned into electricity. Huygens was supported by Cassini during cruise, but used chemical batteries when independent. The probe contained a DVD with more than 616,400 signatures from citizens in 81 countries, collected in a public campaign. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Until September 2017 the Cassini probe continued orbiting Saturn at a distance of between 8.2 and 10.2 astronomical units (1.23 × 10 9 and 1.53 × 10 9 km ; 760,000,000 and 950,000,000 mi ) from the Earth. It took 68 to 84 minutes for radio signals to travel from Earth to the spacecraft, and vice versa. Thus ground controllers could not give "real-time" instructions for daily operations or for unexpected events. Even if response were immediate, more than two hours would have passed between the occurrence of a problem and the reception of the engineers' response by the satellite.

Telemetry from the communications antenna and other special transmitters (an S-band transmitter and a dual-frequency K a -band system) was also used to make observations of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn and to measure the gravity fields of the planet and its satellites. Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) CAPS was an in situ instrument that measured the flux of charged particles at the location of the spacecraft, as a function of direction and energy. The ion composition was also measured using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer . CAPS measured particles produced by ionisation of molecules originating from Saturn's and Titan's ionosphere, as well as the plumes of Enceladus. CAPS also investigated plasma in these areas, along with the solar wind and its interaction with Saturn's magnetosphere. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] CAPS was turned off in June 2011, as a precaution due to a "soft" electrical short circuit that occurred in the instrument. It was powered on again in March 2012, but after 78 days another short circuit forced the instrument to be shut down permanently. [ 52 ] Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) The CDA was an in situ instrument that measured the size, speed, and direction of tiny dust grains near Saturn. It could also measure the grains' chemical elements. [ 53 ] Some of these particles orbited Saturn, while others came from other star systems. The CDA on the orbiter was designed to learn more about these particles, the materials in other celestial bodies and potentially about the origins of the universe. [ 50 ] Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) The CIRS was a remote sensing instrument that measured the infrared radiation coming from objects to learn about their temperatures, thermal properties, and compositions. Throughout the Cassini–Huygens mission, the CIRS measured infrared emissions from atmospheres, rings and surfaces in the vast Saturn system. It mapped the atmosphere of Saturn in three dimensions to determine temperature and pressure profiles with altitude, gas composition, and the distribution of aerosols and clouds. It also measured thermal characteristics and the composition of satellite surfaces and rings. [ 50 ] Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) The INMS was an in situ instrument that measured the composition of charged particles (protons and heavier ions) and neutral particles (atoms and molecules) near Titan and Saturn to learn more about their atmospheres.  The instrument used a quadrupole mass spectrometer . INMS was also intended to measure the positive ion and neutral environments of Saturn's icy satellites and rings. [ 50 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) The ISS was a remote sensing instrument that captured most images in visible light , and also some infrared images and ultraviolet images. The ISS took hundreds of thousands of images of Saturn, its rings, and its moons. The ISS had both a wide-angle camera (WAC) and a narrow-angle camera (NAC). Each of these cameras used a sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) as its electromagnetic wave detector. Each CCD had a 1,024x1,024 square array of pixels, each pixel 12 μm square. Both cameras allowed for many data collection modes, including on-chip data compression, and were fitted with spectral filters that rotated on a wheel to view different bands within the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from 0.2 to 1.1 μm. [ 50 ] [ 56 ] Dual Technique Magnetometer (MAG) The MAG was an in situ instrument that measured the strength and direction of the magnetic field around Saturn . The magnetic fields are generated partly by the molten core at Saturn's center. Measuring the magnetic field is one of the ways to probe the core. MAG aimed to develop a three-dimensional model of Saturn's magnetosphere, and determine the magnetic state of Titan and its atmosphere, and the icy satellites and their role in the magnetosphere of Saturn. [ 50 ] [ 57 ] Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) The MIMI was both an in situ and remote sensing instrument that produces images and other data about the particles trapped in Saturn's huge magnetic field, or magnetosphere. The in situ component measured energetic ions and electrons while the remote sensing component (the Ion And Neutral Camera, INCA) was an energetic neutral atom imager. [ 58 ] This information was used to study the overall configuration and dynamics of the magnetosphere and its interactions with the solar wind, Saturn's atmosphere, Titan, rings, and icy satellites. [ 50 ] [ 59 ] Radar The on-board radar was an active and passive sensing instrument that produced maps of Titan's surface. Radar waves were powerful enough to penetrate the thick veil of haze surrounding Titan. By measuring the send and return time of the signals it is possible to determine the height of large surface features, such as mountains and canyons. The passive radar listened for radio waves that Saturn or its moons may emit. [ 50 ] Radio and Plasma Wave Science instrument (RPWS) The RPWS was an in situ instrument and remote sensing instrument that receives and measures radio signals coming from Saturn, including the radio waves given off by the interaction of the solar wind with Saturn and Titan. RPWS measured the electric and magnetic wave fields in the interplanetary medium and planetary magnetospheres. It also determined the electron density and temperature near Titan and in some regions of Saturn's magnetosphere using either plasma waves at characteristic frequencies (e.g. the upper hybrid line) or a Langmuir probe . RPWS studied the configuration of Saturn's magnetic field and its relationship to Saturn Kilometric Radiation (SKR), as well as monitoring and mapping Saturn's ionosphere, plasma, and lightning from Saturn's (and possibly Titan's) atmosphere. [ 50 ] Radio Science Subsystem (RSS) The RSS was a remote-sensing instrument that used radio antennas on Earth to observe the way radio signals from the spacecraft changed as they were sent through objects, such as Titan's atmosphere or Saturn's rings, or even behind the Sun . The RSS also studied the compositions, pressures and temperatures of atmospheres and ionospheres, radial structure and particle size distribution within rings, body and system masses and the gravitational field . The instrument used the spacecraft X-band communication link as well as S-band downlink and K a -band uplink and downlink. [ 50 ] Cassini UVIS instrument built by the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado. Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) The UVIS was a remote-sensing instrument that captured images of the ultraviolet light reflected off an object, such as the clouds of Saturn and/or its rings, to learn more about their structure and composition. Designed to measure ultraviolet light over wavelengths from 55.8 to 190 nm, this instrument was also a tool to help determine the composition, distribution, aerosol particle content and temperatures of their atmospheres. Unlike other types of spectrometer, this sensitive instrument could take both spectral and spatial readings. It was particularly adept at determining the composition of gases. Spatial observations took a wide-by-narrow view, only one pixel tall and 64 pixels across. The spectral dimension was 1,024 pixels per spatial pixel. It could also take many images that create movies of the ways in which this material is moved around by other forces. [ 50 ] UVIS consisted of four separate detector channels, the Far Ultraviolet (FUV), Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV), High Speed Photometer (HSP) and the Hydrogen-Deuterium Absorption Cell (HDAC).  UVIS collected hyperspectral imagery and discrete spectra of Saturn, its moons and its rings, as well as stellar occultation data. [ 60 ] The HSP channel is designed to observe starlight that passes through Saturn's rings (known as stellar occultations) in order to understand the structure and optical depth of the rings. [ 61 ] Stellar occultation data from both the HSP and FUV channels confirmed the existence of water vapor plumes at the south pole of Enceladus, as well as characterized the composition of the plumes. [ 62 ] VIMS spectra taken while looking through Titan's atmosphere towards the Sun helped understand the atmospheres of exoplanets (artist's concept; May 27, 2014). Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) The VIMS was a remote sensing instrument that captured images using visible and infrared light to learn more about the composition of moon surfaces, the rings, and the atmospheres of Saturn and Titan. It consisted of two cameras - one used to measure visible light, the other infrared. VIMS measured reflected and emitted radiation from atmospheres, rings and surfaces over wavelengths from 350 to 5100 nm, to help determine their compositions, temperatures and structures. It also observed the sunlight and starlight that passes through the rings to learn more about their structure. Scientists used VIMS for long-term studies of cloud movement and morphology in the Saturn system, to determine Saturn's weather patterns. [ 50 ] Plutonium power source [ edit ] A Cassini GPHS-RTG before installation Because of Saturn's distance from the Sun, solar arrays were not feasible as power sources for this space probe. [ 63 ] To generate enough power, such arrays would have been too large and too heavy. [ 63 ] Instead, the Cassini orbiter was powered by three GPHS-RTG radioisotope thermoelectric generators , which use heat from the decay of about 33 kg (73 lb) of plutonium-238 (in the form of plutonium dioxide ) to generate direct current electricity via thermoelectrics . [ 63 ] The RTGs on the Cassini mission have the same design as those used on the New Horizons , Galileo , and Ulysses space probes, and they were designed to have very long operational lifetimes. [ 63 ] At the end of the nominal 11-year Cassini mission, they were still able to produce 600 to 700 watts of electrical power. [ 63 ] (Leftover hardware from the Cassini RTG Program was modified and used to power the New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper belt , which was designed and launched later. [ 64 ] ) Electric power distribution was accomplished by 192 solid-state power switches , which also functioned as circuit breakers in the event of an overload condition. The switches used MOSFETs that featured better efficiency and a longer lifetime as compared to conventional switches, while at the same time eliminating transients . However, these solid-state circuit breakers were prone to erroneous tripping (presumably from cosmic rays), requiring them to reset and causing losses in experimental data. [ 65 ] A glowing-hot plutonium pellet  was the power source for the probe's radioisotope thermoelectric generator To gain momentum while already in flight, the trajectory of the Cassini mission included several gravitational slingshot maneuvers: two fly-by passes of Venus , one more of the Earth, and then one of the planet Jupiter . The terrestrial flyby was the final instance when the probe posed any conceivable danger to human beings. The maneuver was successful, with Cassini passing by 1,171 km (728 mi) above the Earth on August 18, 1999. [ 1 ] Had there been any malfunction causing the probe to collide with the Earth, NASA's complete environmental impact study estimated that, in the worst case (with an acute angle of entry in which Cassini would gradually burn up), a significant fraction of the 33 kg [ 46 ] of nuclear fuel inside the RTGs would have been dispersed into the Earth's atmosphere so that up to five billion people (i.e. almost the entire terrestrial population) could have been exposed, causing up to an estimated 5,000 additional cancer deaths over the subsequent decades [ 66 ] (0.0005 per cent, i.e. a fraction 0.000005, of a billion cancer deaths expected anyway from other causes; the product is incorrectly calculated elsewhere [ 67 ] as 500,000 deaths).  However, the chance of this happening were estimated to be less than one in one million, i.e. a chance of one person dying (assuming 5,000 deaths) as less than 1 in 200. [ 66 ] NASA's risk analysis to use plutonium was publicly criticized by Michio Kaku on the grounds that casualties, property damage, and lawsuits resulting from a possible accident, as well as the potential use of other energy sources, such as solar and fuel cells, were underestimated. [ 68 ] Telemetry [ edit ] The Cassini spacecraft was capable of transmitting in several different telemetry formats. The telemetry subsystem is perhaps the most important subsystem, because without it there could be no data return. The telemetry was developed from the ground up, due to the spacecraft using a more modern set of computers than previous missions. [ 69 ] Therefore, Cassini was the first spacecraft to adopt mini-packets to reduce the complexity of the Telemetry Dictionary, and the software development process led to the creation of a Telemetry Manager for the mission. There were around 1088 channels (in 67 mini-packets) assembled in the Cassini Telemetry Dictionary. Out of these 67 lower complexity mini-packets, 6 mini-packets contained the subsystem covariance and Kalman gain elements (161 measurements), not used during normal mission operations. This left 947 measurements in 61 mini-packets. A total of seven telemetry maps corresponding to 7 AACS telemetry modes were constructed. These modes are: (1) Record; (2) Nominal Cruise; (3) Medium Slow Cruise; (4) Slow Cruise; (5) Orbital Ops; (6) Av; (7) ATE (Attitude Estimator) Calibration. These 7 maps cover all spacecraft telemetry modes. Huygens probe [ edit ] Main article: Huygens (spacecraft) Huygens view of Titan's surface Same image with different data processing The Huygens probe, supplied by the European Space Agency (ESA) and named after the 17th century Dutch astronomer who first discovered Titan, Christiaan Huygens , scrutinized the clouds, atmosphere, and surface of Saturn's moon Titan in its descent on January 15, 2005. It was designed to enter and brake in Titan's atmosphere and parachute a fully instrumented robotic laboratory down to the surface. [ 70 ] The probe system consisted of the probe itself which descended to Titan, and the probe support equipment (PSE) which remained attached to the orbiting spacecraft. The PSE includes electronics that track the probe, recover the data gathered during its descent, and process and deliver the data to the orbiter that transmits it to Earth. The core control computer CPU was a redundant MIL-STD-1750A control system. The data were transmitted by a radio link between Huygens and Cassini provided by Probe Data Relay Subsystem (PDRS). As the probe's mission could not be telecommanded from Earth because of the great distance, it was automatically managed by the Command Data Management Subsystem (CDMS). The PDRS and CDMS were provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI). After Cassini 's launch, it was discovered that data sent from the Huygens probe to Cassini orbiter (and then re-transmitted to Earth) would be largely unreadable. The cause was that the bandwidth of signal processing electronics was too narrow and the anticipated Doppler shift between the lander and the mother craft would put the signals out of the system's range. Thus, Cassini 's receiver would be unable to receive the data from Huygens during its descent to Titan. [ 20 ] A work-around was found to recover the mission. The trajectory of Cassini was altered to reduce the line of sight velocity and therefore the doppler shift. [ 20 ] [ 71 ] Cassini' s subsequent trajectory was identical to the previously planned one, although the change replaced two orbits prior to the Huygens mission with three, shorter orbits. Selected events and discoveries [ edit ] Main article: Cassini–Huygens timeline Animation of Cassini 's trajectory from October 15, 1997, to May 4, 2008. Cassini–Huygens Jupiter Saturn Earth Venus 2685 Masursky Animation of Cassini 's trajectory around Saturn from May 1, 2004, to September 15, 2017. Cassini Saturn Enceladus Titan Iapetus Venus and Earth fly-bys and the cruise to Jupiter [ edit ] Picture of the Moon during flyby The Cassini space probe performed two gravitational-assist flybys of Venus on April 26, 1998, and June 24, 1999. These flybys provided the space probe with enough momentum to travel all the way out to the asteroid belt , while the Sun's gravity pulled the space probe back into the inner Solar System. On August 18, 1999, at 03:28 UTC, the craft made a gravitational-assist flyby of the Earth. One hour and 20 minutes before closest approach, Cassini made its closest approach to the Earth's Moon at 377,000 kilometers, and it took a series of calibration photos. On January 23, 2000, Cassini performed a flyby of the asteroid 2685 Masursky at around 10:00 UTC. It took photos [ 72 ] in the period five to seven hours before the flyby at a distance of 1.6 × 10 ^ 6 km (0.99 × 10 ^ 6 mi) and a diameter of 15 to 20 km (9.3 to 12.4 mi) was estimated for the asteroid. Jupiter flyby [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. Find sources: "Cassini–Huygens" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( October 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A Jupiter flyby picture Cassini made its closest approach to Jupiter on December 30, 2000, at 9.7 million kilometers, and made many scientific measurements. About 26,000 images of Jupiter, its faint rings , and its moons were taken during the six-month flyby. It produced the most detailed global color portrait of the planet yet (see image at right), in which the smallest visible features are approximately 60 km (37 mi) across. [ 73 ] Cassini photographed Io transiting Jupiter on January 1, 2001. A major finding of the flyby, announced on March 6, 2003, was of Jupiter's atmospheric circulation. Dark "belts" alternate with light "zones" in the atmosphere, and scientists had long considered the zones, with their pale clouds, to be areas of upwelling air, partly because many clouds on Earth form where air is rising. But analysis of Cassini imagery showed that individual storm cells of upwelling bright-white clouds, too small to see from Earth, pop up almost without exception in the dark belts. According to Anthony Del Genio of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies , "the belts must be the areas of net-rising atmospheric motion on Jupiter, [so] the net motion in the zones has to be sinking". Other atmospheric observations included a swirling dark oval of high atmospheric haze, about the size of the Great Red Spot , near Jupiter's north pole. Infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles, with bands of globe-encircling winds, with adjacent bands moving in opposite directions. The same announcement also discussed the nature of Jupiter's rings . Light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originate as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on Jupiter's moons, probably Metis and Adrastea . Tests of general relativity [ edit ] On October 10, 2003, the mission's science team announced the results of tests of Albert Einstein 's general theory of relativity , performed by using radio waves transmitted from the Cassini space probe. [ 74 ] The radio scientists measured a frequency shift in the radio waves to and from the spacecraft, as they passed close to the Sun. According to the general theory of relativity, a massive object like the Sun causes space-time to curve, causing a beam of radiowaves travelling out of its gravitational well to decrease in frequency and radiowaves travelling into the gravitational well to increase in frequency, referred to as gravitational redshift / blueshift. Although some measurable deviations from the values calculated using the general theory of relativity are predicted by some unusual cosmological models, no such deviations were found by this experiment. Previous tests using radiowaves transmitted by the Viking and Voyager space probes were in agreement with the calculated values from general relativity to within an accuracy of one part in one thousand. The more refined measurements from the Cassini space probe experiment improved this accuracy to about one part in 51,000. [ a ] The data firmly support Einstein's general theory of relativity. [ 75 ] New moons of Saturn [ edit ] The possible formation of a new moon was captured on April 15, 2013. In total, the Cassini mission discovered seven new moons orbiting Saturn. [ 76 ] Using images taken by Cassini , researchers discovered Methone , Pallene and Polydeuces in 2004, [ 77 ] although later analysis revealed that Voyager 2 had photographed Pallene in its 1981 flyby of the ringed planet. [ 78 ] Discovery photograph of moon Daphnis On May 1, 2005, a new moon was discovered by Cassini in the Keeler gap . It was given the designation S/2005 S 1 before being named Daphnis . A fifth new moon was discovered by Cassini on May 30, 2007, and was provisionally labeled S/2007 S 4. It is now known as Anthe . A press release on February 3, 2009, showed a sixth new moon found by Cassini . The moon is approximately 500 m (0.3 mi) in diameter within the G-ring of the ring system of Saturn, and is now named Aegaeon (formerly S/2008 S 1). [ 79 ] A press release on November 2, 2009, mentions the seventh new moon found by Cassini on July 26, 2009. It is presently labeled S/2009 S 1 and is approximately 300 m (980 ft) in diameter in the B-ring system. [ 80 ] On April 14, 2014, NASA scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon in Saturn's A Ring . [ 81 ] Phoebe flyby [ edit ] Cassini arrival (left) and departure mosaics of Phoebe (2004) On June 11, 2004, Cassini flew by the moon Phoebe .  This was the first opportunity for close-up studies of this moon ( Voyager 2 performed a distant flyby in 1981 but returned no detailed images). It also was Cassini's only possible flyby for Phoebe due to the mechanics of the available orbits around Saturn. [ 82 ] The first close-up images were received on June 12, 2004, and mission scientists immediately realized that the surface of Phoebe looks different from asteroids visited by spacecraft. Parts of the heavily cratered surface look very bright in those pictures, and it is currently believed that a large amount of water ice exists under its immediate surface. Saturn rotation [ edit ] In an announcement on June 28, 2004, Cassini program scientists described the measurement of the rotational period of Saturn. [ 83 ] Because there are no fixed features on the surface that can be used to obtain this period, the repetition of radio emissions was used. This new data agreed with the latest values measured from Earth, and constituted a puzzle to the scientists. It turns out that the radio rotational period had changed since it was first measured in 1980 by Voyager 1 , and it was now 6 minutes longer. This, however, does not indicate a change in the overall spin of the planet. It is thought to be due to variations in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere at the latitudes which are magnetically connected to the radio source region. [ 84 ] In 2019 NASA announced Saturn's rotational period as 10 hours, 33 minutes, 38 seconds, calculated using Saturnian ring seismology. Vibrations from Saturn's interior cause oscillations in its gravitational field. This energy is absorbed by ring particles in specific locations, where it accumulates until it is released in a wave. [ 85 ] Scientists used data from more than 20 of these waves to construct a family of models of Saturn's interior, providing basis for calculating its rotational period. [ 86 ] Orbiting Saturn [ edit ] Saturn reached equinox in 2008, shortly after the end of the prime mission. On July 1, 2004, the spacecraft flew through the gap between the F and G rings and achieved orbit , after a seven-year voyage. [ 87 ] It was the first spacecraft to orbit Saturn. The Saturn Orbital Insertion (SOI) maneuver performed by Cassini was complex, requiring the craft to orient its High-Gain Antenna away from Earth and along its flight path, to shield its instruments from particles in Saturn's rings. Once the craft crossed the ring plane, it had to rotate again to point its engine along its flight path, and then the engine fired to decelerate the craft by 622 m/s to allow Saturn to capture it. [ 88 ] Cassini was captured by Saturn's gravity at around 8:54 pm Pacific Daylight Time on June 30, 2004. During the maneuver Cassini passed within 20,000 km (12,000 mi) of Saturn's cloud tops. When Cassini was in Saturnian orbit, departure from the Saturn system was evaluated in 2008 during end of mission planning. [ 89 ] [ clarification needed ] Titan flybys [ edit ] Titan – infrared views (2004 – 2017) Cassini had its first flyby of Saturn's largest moon, Titan , on July 2, 2004, a day after orbit insertion, when it approached to within 339,000 km (211,000 mi) of Titan. Images taken through special filters (able to see through the moon's global haze) showed south polar clouds thought to be composed of methane and surface features with widely differing brightness. On October 27, 2004, the spacecraft executed the first of the 45 planned close flybys of Titan when it passed a mere 1,200 km (750 mi) above the moon. Almost four gigabits of data were collected and transmitted to Earth, including the first radar images of the moon's haze-enshrouded surface. It revealed the surface of Titan (at least the area covered by radar) to be relatively level, with topography reaching no more than about 50 m (160 ft) in altitude. The flyby provided a remarkable increase in imaging resolution over previous coverage. Images with up to 100 times better resolution were taken and are typical of resolutions planned for subsequent Titan flybys. Cassini collected pictures of Titan and the lakes of methane were similar to the lakes of water on Earth. Huygens lands on Titan [ edit ] Main article: Huygens (spacecraft) External image Raw images from the Huygens probe descent on 14 January 2005 (37 pages) ESA/NASA/JPL/University of Arizona (ESA hosting) Cassini released the Huygens probe on December 25, 2004, by means of a spring and spiral rails intended to rotate the probe for greater stability. It entered the atmosphere of Titan on January 14, 2005, and after a two-and-a-half-hour descent landed on solid ground. [ 6 ] Although Cassini successfully relayed 350 of the pictures that it received from Huygens of its descent and landing site, a malfunction in one of the communications channels resulted in the loss of a further 350 pictures. [ 90 ] Enceladus flybys [ edit ] View of Enceladus's Europa -like surface with the Labtayt Sulci fractures at center and the Ebony (left) and Cufa dorsa at lower left; imaged by Cassini on February 17, 2005 During the first two close flybys of the moon Enceladus in 2005, Cassini discovered a deflection in the local magnetic field that is characteristic for the existence of a thin but significant atmosphere. Other measurements obtained at that time point to ionized water vapor as its main constituent. Cassini also observed water ice geysers erupting from the south pole of Enceladus, which gives more credibility to the idea that Enceladus is supplying the particles of Saturn's E ring. Mission scientists began to suspect that there may be pockets of liquid water near the surface of the moon that fuel the eruptions. [ 91 ] On March 12, 2008, Cassini made a close fly-by of Enceladus, passing within 50 km of the moon's surface. [ 92 ] The spacecraft passed through the plumes extending from its southern geysers, detecting water, carbon dioxide and various hydrocarbons with its mass spectrometer, while also mapping surface features that are at much higher temperature than their surroundings with the infrared spectrometer. [ 93 ] Cassini was unable to collect data with its cosmic dust analyzer due to an unknown software malfunction. On November 21, 2009, Cassini made its eighth flyby of Enceladus, [ 94 ] this time with a different geometry, approaching within 1,600 km (990 mi) of the surface. The Composite Infrared Spectrograph (CIRS) instrument produced a map of thermal emissions from the Baghdad Sulcus 'tiger stripe' . The data returned helped create a detailed and high resolution mosaic image of the southern part of the moon's Saturn-facing hemisphere. On April 3, 2014, nearly ten years after Cassini entered Saturn's orbit, NASA reported evidence of a large salty internal ocean of liquid water in Enceladus. The presence of an internal salty ocean in contact with the moon's rocky core, places Enceladus "among the most likely places in the Solar System to host alien microbial life ". [ 95 ] [ 96 ] [ 97 ] On June 30, 2014, NASA celebrated ten years of Cassini exploring Saturn and its moons , highlighting the discovery of water activity on Enceladus among other findings. [ 98 ] In September 2015, NASA announced that gravitational and imaging data from Cassini were used to analyze the librations of Enceladus's orbit and determined that the moon's surface is not rigidly joined to its core, concluding that the underground ocean must therefore be global in extent. [ 99 ] On October 28, 2015, Cassini performed a close flyby of Enceladus, coming within  49 km (30 mi) of the surface, and passing through the icy plume above the south pole . [ 100 ] On December 14, 2023, astronomers reported the first time discovery, in the plumes of Enceladus, of hydrogen cyanide , a possible chemical essential for life as we know it, as well as other organic molecules , some of which are yet to be better identified and understood. According to the researchers, "these [newly discovered] compounds could potentially support extant microbial communities or drive complex organic synthesis leading to the origin of life ". [ 101 ] [ 102 ] Radio occultations of Saturn's rings [ edit ] In May 2005, Cassini began a series of radio occultation experiments, to measure the size-distribution of particles in Saturn's rings , and measure the atmosphere of Saturn itself. For over four months, the craft completed orbits designed for this purpose. During these experiments, it flew behind the ring plane of Saturn, as seen from Earth, and transmitted radio waves through the particles. The radio signals received on Earth were analyzed, for frequency, phase, and power shift of the signal to determine the structure of the rings. Upper image: visible color mosaic of Saturn's rings taken on December 12, 2004. Lower image: simulated view constructed from a radio occultation observation on May 3, 2005. Color in the lower image represents ring particle sizes. Spokes in rings verified [ edit ] In images captured September 5, 2005, Cassini detected spokes in Saturn's rings, [ 103 ] previously seen only by the visual observer Stephen James O'Meara in 1977 and then confirmed by the Voyager space probes in the early 1980s. [ 104 ] [ 105 ] Lakes of Titan [ edit ] Main article: Lakes of Titan Ligeia Mare , on the left, is compared at scale to Lake Superior . Titan : evolving feature in Ligeia Mare (August 21, 2014) Radar images obtained on July 21, 2006, appear to show lakes of liquid hydrocarbon (such as methane and ethane ) in Titan's northern latitudes. This is the first discovery of currently existing lakes anywhere besides on Earth. The lakes range in size from one to one-hundred kilometers across. [ 91 ] On March 13, 2007, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced that it had found strong evidence of seas of methane and ethane in the northern hemisphere of Titan. At least one of these is larger than any of the Great Lakes in North America. [ 106 ] Saturn hurricane [ edit ] In November 2006, scientists discovered a storm at the south pole of Saturn with a distinct eyewall . This is characteristic of a hurricane on Earth and had never been seen on another planet before. Unlike a terrestrial hurricane, the storm appears to be stationary at the pole. The storm is 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across, and 70 km (43 mi) high, with winds blowing at 560 km/h (350 mph). [ 107 ] Iapetus flyby [ edit ] Taken on September 10, 2007, at a distance of 62,331 km (38,731 mi) Iapetus's equatorial ridge and surface are revealed. (CL1 and CL2 filters) Closeup of Iapetus surface, 2007 On September 10, 2007, Cassini completed its flyby of the strange, two-toned, walnut-shaped moon, Iapetus . Images were taken from 1,600 km (1,000 mi) above the surface. As it was sending the images back to Earth, it was hit by a cosmic ray that forced it to temporarily enter safe mode . All of the data from the flyby was recovered. [ 108 ] Mission extension [ edit ] On April 15, 2008, Cassini received funding for a 27-month extended mission. It consisted of 60 more orbits of Saturn , with 21 more close Titan flybys, seven of Enceladus, six of Mimas, eight of Tethys, and one targeted flyby each of Dione , Rhea , and Helene . [ 109 ] The extended mission began on July 1, 2008, and was renamed the Cassini Equinox Mission as the mission coincided with Saturn's equinox . [ 110 ] Second mission extension [ edit ] A proposal was submitted to NASA for a second mission extension (September 2010 – May 2017), provisionally named the extended-extended mission or XXM. [ 111 ] This ($60M pa) was approved in February 2010 and renamed the Cassini Solstice Mission . [ 112 ] It included Cassini orbiting Saturn 155 more times, conducting 54 additional flybys of Titan and 11 more of Enceladus. Great Storm of 2010 and aftermath [ edit ] Northern hemisphere storm in 2011 On October 25, 2012, Cassini witnessed the aftermath of the massive Great White Spot storm that recurs roughly every 30 years on Saturn. [ 113 ] Data from the composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS) instrument indicated a powerful discharge from the storm that caused a temperature spike in the stratosphere of Saturn 83 K (83 °C; 149 °F) above normal. Simultaneously, a huge increase in ethylene gas was detected by NASA researchers at Goddard Research Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.  Ethylene is a colorless gas that is highly uncommon on Saturn and is produced both naturally and through man-made sources on Earth. The storm that produced this discharge was first observed by the spacecraft on December 5, 2010, in Saturn's northern hemisphere. The storm is the first of its kind to be observed by a spacecraft in orbit around Saturn as well as the first to be observed at thermal infrared wavelengths, allowing scientists to observe the temperature of Saturn's atmosphere and track phenomena that are invisible to the naked eye. The spike of ethylene gas that was produced by the storm reached levels that were 100 times more than those thought possible for Saturn. Scientists have also determined that the storm witnessed was the largest, hottest stratospheric vortex ever detected in the Solar System, initially being larger than Jupiter's Great Red Spot . Venus transit [ edit ] On December 21, 2012, Cassini observed a transit of Venus across the Sun. The VIMS instrument analyzed sunlight passing through the Venusian atmosphere. VIMS previously observed the transit of exoplanet HD 189733 b . [ 114 ] The Day the Earth Smiled [ edit ] Main article: The Day the Earth Smiled The Day the Earth Smiled – Saturn with some of its moons, Earth , Venus , and Mars as visible in this Cassini montage (July 19, 2013) [ 115 ] On July 19, 2013, the probe was pointed towards Earth to capture an image of the Earth and the Moon , as part of a natural light, multi-image portrait of the entire Saturn system. The event was unique as it was the first time NASA informed the public that a long-distance photo was being taken in advance. [ 115 ] [ 116 ] The imaging team said they wanted people to smile and wave to the skies, with Cassini scientist Carolyn Porco describing the moment as a chance to "celebrate life on the Pale Blue Dot ". [ 117 ] Rhea flyby [ edit ] On February 10, 2015, the Cassini spacecraft visited Rhea more closely, coming within 47,000 km (29,000 mi). [ 118 ] The spacecraft observed the moon with its cameras producing some of the highest resolution color images yet of Rhea. [ 119 ] Hyperion flyby [ edit ] Cassini performed its latest flyby of Saturn's moon Hyperion on May 31, 2015, at a distance of about 34,000 km (21,000 mi). [ 120 ] Hyperion – context view from 37,000 km (23,000 mi) (May 31, 2015) Hyperion – close-up view from 38,000 km (24,000 mi) (May 31, 2015) Dione flyby [ edit ] Cassini performed its last flyby of Saturn's moon Dione on August 17, 2015, at a distance of about 475 km (295 mi). A previous flyby was performed on June 16. [ 121 ] Hexagon changes color [ edit ] Main article: Saturn's hexagon Between 2012 and 2016, the persistent hexagonal cloud pattern at Saturn's north pole changed from a mostly blue color to more of a golden color. [ 122 ] One theory for this is a seasonal change: extended exposure to sunlight may be creating haze as the pole swivels toward the Sun. [ 122 ] It was previously noted that there was less blue color overall on Saturn between 2004 and 2008. [ 111 ] 2012 and 2016: hexagon color changes 2013 and 2017: hexagon color changes Grand Finale and destruction [ edit ] Main article: Cassini retirement Animation of Cassini ' s Grand Finale Cassini Saturn Cassini 's end, named the Grand Finale, involved a series of close Saturn passes, approaching within the rings , then an entry into Saturn's atmosphere on September 15, 2017, to destroy the spacecraft. [ 6 ] [ 12 ] [ 89 ] This method was chosen to ensure protection and prevent biological contamination to any of the moons of Saturn thought to offer potential habitability . [ 123 ] In 2008, a number of options were evaluated to achieve this goal, each with varying funding, scientific, and technical challenges. A short period Saturn impact for an end of mission was rated "excellent" with the reasons "D-ring option satisfies unachieved AO goals; [ definition needed ] cheap and easily achievable" while collision with an icy moon was rated "good" for being "cheap and achievable anywhere/time". [ 89 ] There were problems in 2013–14 about NASA receiving U.S. government funding for the Grand Finale. The two phases of the Grand Finale ended up being the equivalent of having two separate Discovery -class missions in that the Grand Finale was completely different from the main Cassini regular mission. The U.S. government in late 2014 approved the Grand Finale at the cost of $200 million. This was far cheaper than building two new probes in separate Discovery -class missions. [ 124 ] On November 29, 2016, the spacecraft performed a Titan flyby that took it to the gateway of F-ring orbits: This was the start of the Grand Finale phase culminating in its impact with the planet. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] A final Titan flyby on April 22, 2017, changed the orbit again to fly through the gap between Saturn and its inner ring days later on April 26. Cassini passed about 3,100 km (1,900 mi) above Saturn's cloud layer and 320 km (200 mi) from the visible edge of the inner ring; it successfully took images of Saturn's atmosphere and began returning data the next day. [ 127 ] After a further 22 orbits through the gap, the mission was ended with a dive into Saturn's atmosphere on September 15; signal was lost at 11:55:46 UTC  on September 15, 2017, 30 seconds later than predicted. It is estimated that the spacecraft burned up about 45 seconds after the last transmission. In September 2018, NASA won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Interactive Program for its presentation of the Cassini mission's Grand Finale at Saturn . [ 128 ] In December 2018, Netflix aired "NASA's Cassini Mission" on their series 7 Days Out documenting the final days of work on the Cassini mission before the spacecraft crashed into Saturn to complete its Grand Finale. In January 2019, new research using data collected during Cassini 's Grand Finale phase was published: The final close passes by the rings and planet enabled scientists to measure the length of a day on Saturn: 10 hours, 33 minutes and 38 seconds. Saturn's rings are relatively new, 10 to 100 million years old.

Missions [ edit ] The spacecraft operation was organized around a series of missions. [ 17 ] Each was structured according to a certain amount of funding, goals, etc. [ 17 ] At least 260 scientists from 17 countries have worked on the Cassini–Huygens mission; in addition thousands of people overall worked to design, manufacture, and launch the mission. [ 130 ] Prime Mission, July 2004 through June 2008. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] Cassini Equinox Mission was a two-year mission extension which ran from July 2008 through September 2010.

NASA robotic rover exploring Gale crater on Mars Curiosity Part of Mars Science Laboratory Self-portrait by Curiosity at the foot of Mount Sharp in October 2015 Type Mars rover Owner NASA Manufacturer Jet Propulsion Laboratory Specifications Dimensions 2.9 m × 2.7 m × 2.2 m (9 ft 6 in × 8 ft 10 in × 7 ft 3 in) Dry mass 899 kilograms (1,982 lb) Communication UHF : ~400 MHz , 2 Mbit/s X band : 7–8 GHz, 800 bit/s Power MMRTG : ~100 W (0.13 hp) Rocket Atlas V 541 Instruments APXS ChemCam CheMin DAN Hazcam × 8 MAHLI MARDI MastCam Navcam × 4 RAD REMS SAM History Launched November 26, 2011, 15:02 UTC ( 2011-11-26UTC15:02 ) from Cape Canaveral SLC-41 Deployed August 6, 2012, 05:17 UTC ; 13 years ago ( August 6, 2012, 05:17 UTC ) from the MSL EDLS Location Gale crater , Mars Traveled 35.97 km (22.35 mi) on Mars as of 27 September 2025 [update] [ 1 ] NASA Mars rovers ← Opportunity Perseverance → Curiosity is a Mars rover that is exploring Gale crater and Mount Sharp on Mars as part of NASA 's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. [ 2 ] Launched in 2011 and landed the following year, the car-sized rover continues to operate more than a decade after its original two-year mission. Curiosity was launched from Cape Canaveral , Florida on November 26, 2011, at 15:02:00 UTC and landed on Aeolis Palus inside Gale crater on Mars on August 6, 2012, 05:17:57 UTC. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The Bradbury Landing site was less than 2.4 km (1.5 mi) from the center of the rover's touchdown target after a 560 million km (350 million mi) journey. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Mission goals include an investigation of the Martian climate and geology , an assessment of whether the selected field site inside Gale has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life (including investigation of the role of water ), and planetary habitability studies in preparation for human exploration . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] In December 2012, Curiosity 's two-year mission was extended indefinitely. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] On August 6, 2022, a detailed overview of accomplishments by the Curiosity rover for the last ten years was reported. [ 13 ] The rover is still operational, and as of 24 February 2026, Curiosity has been active on Mars for 4818 sols (4950 total days ; 13 years, 202 days ) since its landing (see current status ). The NASA/JPL Mars Science Laboratory/ Curiosity Project Team was awarded the 2012 Robert J. Collier Trophy by the National Aeronautic Association "In recognition of the extraordinary achievements of successfully landing Curiosity on Mars, advancing the nation's technological and engineering capabilities, and significantly improving humanity's understanding of ancient Martian habitable environments." [ 14 ] Curiosity 's rover design serves as the basis for NASA's 2021 Perseverance mission , which carries different scientific instruments. Mission [ edit ] Further information: Timeline of Mars Science Laboratory Goals and objectives [ edit ] Animation of the Curiosity rover, showing its capabilities As established by the Mars Exploration Program , the main scientific goals of the MSL mission are to help determine whether Mars could ever have supported life , as well as determining the role of water , and to study the climate and geology of Mars . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The mission results will also help prepare for human exploration. [ 9 ] To contribute to these goals, MSL has eight main scientific objectives: [ 15 ] Biological Determine the nature and inventory of organic carbon compounds Investigate the chemical building blocks of life (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur ) Identify features that may represent the effects of biological processes ( biosignatures and biomolecules ) Geological and geochemical Investigate the chemical, isotopic , and mineralogical composition of the Martian surface and near-surface geological materials Interpret the processes that have formed and modified rocks and soils Planetary process Assess long-timescale (i.e., 4-billion-year) Martian atmospheric evolution processes Determine present state, distribution, and cycling of water and carbon dioxide Surface radiation Characterize the broad spectrum of surface radiation, including galactic and cosmic radiation , solar proton events and secondary neutrons . As part of its exploration, it also measured the radiation exposure in the interior of the spacecraft as it traveled to Mars, and it is continuing radiation measurements as it explores the surface of Mars. This data would be important for a future crewed mission . [ 16 ] About one year into the surface mission, and having assessed that ancient Mars could have been hospitable to microbial life, the MSL mission objectives evolved to developing predictive models for the preservation process of organic compounds and biomolecules ; a branch of paleontology called taphonomy . [ 17 ] The region it is set to explore has been compared to the Four Corners region of the North American west . [ 18 ] Name [ edit ] A NASA panel selected the name Curiosity following a nationwide student contest that attracted more than 9,000 proposals via the Internet and mail. Twelve-year-old Clara Ma from Sunflower Elementary School in Lenexa, Kansas submitted the winning entry. As her prize, Ma won a trip to NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California , where she signed her name directly onto the rover as it was being assembled. [ 19 ] Ma wrote in her winning essay: Curiosity is an everlasting flame that burns in everyone's mind. It makes me get out of bed in the morning and wonder what surprises life will throw at me that day. Curiosity is such a powerful force. Without it, we wouldn't be who we are today. Curiosity is the passion that drives us through our everyday lives. We have become explorers and scientists with our need to ask questions and to wonder. [ 19 ] Cost [ edit ] Adjusted for inflation, Curiosity has a life-cycle cost of US$3.2 billion dollars in 2020. By comparison, the 2021 Perseverance rover has a life-cycle cost of US$2.9 billion. [ 20 ] Rover and lander specifications [ edit ] See also: Comparison of embedded computer systems on board the Mars rovers Two Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineers stand with three vehicles, providing a size comparison of three generations of Mars rovers. Front and center left is the flight spare for the first Mars rover, Sojourner , which landed on Mars in 1997 as part of the Mars Pathfinder Project . On the left is a Mars Exploration Rover (MER) test vehicle that is a working sibling to Spirit and Opportunity , which landed on Mars in 2004. On the right is a test rover for the Mars Science Laboratory , which landed as Curiosity on Mars in 2012. Sojourner is 65 cm (26 in) long. The Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) are 1.6 m (5 ft 3 in) long. Curiosity on the right is 3 m (9.8 ft) long. Curiosity is 2.9 m (9 ft 6 in) long by 2.7 m (8 ft 10 in) wide by 2.2 m (7 ft 3 in) high, [ 21 ] larger than Mars Exploration Rovers, which are 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) long and have a mass of 174 kg (384 lb) including 6.8 kg (15 lb) of scientific instruments. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] In comparison to Pancam on the Mars Exploration Rovers, the MastCam-34 has 1.25× higher spatial resolution and the MastCam-100 has 3.67× higher spatial resolution. [ 25 ] Curiosity has an advanced payload of scientific equipment on Mars. [ 26 ] It is the fourth NASA robotic rover sent to Mars since 1996. Previous successful Mars rovers are Sojourner from the Mars Pathfinder mission (1997), and Spirit (2004–2010) and Opportunity (2004–2018) rovers from the Mars Exploration Rover mission. Curiosity comprised 23% of the mass of the 3,893 kg (8,583 lb) spacecraft at launch. The remaining mass was discarded in the process of transport and landing. Dimensions : Curiosity has a mass of 899 kg (1,982 lb) including 80 kg (180 lb) of scientific instruments. [ 22 ] The rover is 2.9 m (9 ft 6 in) long by 2.7 m (8 ft 10 in) wide by 2.2 m (7 ft 3 in) in height. [ 21 ] The main box-like chassis forms the Warm Electronics Box (WEB). [ 27 ] : 52 Radioisotope pellet within a graphite shell that fuels the generator Radioisotope Power System for Curiosity at Kennedy Space Center Power source : Curiosity is powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), like the successful Viking 1 and Viking 2 Mars landers in 1976. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Radioisotope power systems (RPSs) are generators that produce electricity from the decay of radioactive isotopes , such as plutonium-238 , which is a non- fissile isotope of plutonium. Heat given off by the decay of this isotope generates electrical power using thermocouples , providing consistent power during all seasons and through the day and night. Waste heat is also used via pipes to warm systems, freeing electrical power for the operation of the vehicle and instruments. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Curiosity 's RTG is fueled by 4.8 kg (11 lb) of plutonium-238 dioxide supplied by the U.S. Department of Energy . [ 30 ] Curiosity' s RTG is the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), designed and built by Rocketdyne and Teledyne Energy Systems under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy , [ 31 ] and fueled and tested by the Idaho National Laboratory . [ 32 ] Based on legacy RTG technology, it represents a more flexible and compact development step, [ 33 ] and is designed to produce 110 watts of electrical power and about 2,000 watts of thermal power at the start of the mission. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The MMRTG produces less power over time as its plutonium fuel decays: at its minimum lifetime of 14 years, electrical power output is down to 100 watts. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] The power source generates 9 MJ (2.5 kWh) of electrical energy each day, much more than the solar panels of the now retired Mars Exploration Rovers , which generated about 2.1 MJ (0.58 kWh) each day. The electrical output from the MMRTG charges two rechargeable lithium-ion batteries . This enables the power subsystem to meet peak power demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the generator's steady output level. Each battery has a capacity of about 42 ampere hours . Heat rejection system : The temperatures at the landing site vary seasonally and the thermal system warms the rover as needed. The thermal system does so in several ways: passively, through the dissipation to internal components; by electrical heaters strategically placed on key components; and by using the rover heat rejection system (HRS). [ 27 ] It uses fluid pumped through 60 m (200 ft) of tubing [ citation needed ] in the rover body so that sensitive components are kept at optimal temperatures. [ 36 ] The fluid loop serves the additional purpose of rejecting heat when the rover has become too warm, and it can also gather waste heat from the power source by pumping fluid through two heat exchangers that are mounted alongside the RTG. The HRS also has the ability to cool components if necessary. [ 36 ] Computers : The two identical on-board rover computers, called Rover Compute Element (RCE) contain radiation hardened memory to tolerate the extreme radiation from space and to safeguard against power-off cycles. The computers run the VxWorks real-time operating system (RTOS). Each computer's memory includes 256 kilobytes (kB) of EEPROM , 256 megabytes (MB) of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), and 2 gigabytes (GB) of flash memory . [ 37 ] For comparison, the Mars Exploration Rovers used 3 MB of EEPROM, 128 MB of DRAM, and 256 MB of flash memory. [ 38 ] The RCE computers use the RAD750 Central processing unit (CPU), which is a successor to the RAD6000 CPU of the Mars Exploration Rovers. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] The IBM RAD750 CPU, a radiation-hardened version of the PowerPC 750 , can execute up to 400 Million instructions per second (MIPS), while the RAD6000 CPU is capable of up to only 35 MIPS. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Of the two on-board computers, one is configured as backup and will take over in the event of problems with the main computer. [ 37 ] On February 28, 2013, NASA was forced to switch to the backup computer due to a problem with the active computer's flash memory, which resulted in the computer continuously rebooting in a loop. The backup computer was turned on in safe mode and subsequently returned to active status on March 4, 2013. [ 43 ] The same problem happened in late March, resuming full operations on March 25, 2013. [ 44 ] The rover has an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that provides 3-axis information on its position, which is used in rover navigation. [ 37 ] The rover's computers are constantly self-monitoring to keep the rover operational, such as by regulating the rover's temperature. [ 37 ] Activities such as taking pictures, driving, and operating the instruments are performed in a command sequence that is sent from the flight team to the rover. [ 37 ] The rover installed its full surface operations software after the landing because its computers did not have sufficient main memory available during flight. The new software essentially replaced the flight software. [ 7 ] The rover has four processors. One of them is a SPARC processor that runs the rover's thrusters and descent-stage motors as it descended through the Martian atmosphere . Two others are PowerPC processors: the main processor, which handles nearly all of the rover's ground functions, and that processor's backup. The fourth one, another SPARC processor, commands the rover's movement and is part of its motor controller box. All four processors are single core . [ 45 ] Communications [ edit ] Curiosity transmits to Earth directly or via three relay satellites in Mars orbit. Communications : Curiosity is equipped with significant telecommunication redundancy by several means: an X band transmitter and receiver that can communicate directly with Earth, and an Ultra high frequency (UHF) Electra-Lite software-defined radio for communicating with Mars orbiters. [ 27 ] Communication with orbiters is the main path for data return to Earth, since the orbiters have both more power and larger antennas than the lander, allowing for faster transmission speeds. [ 27 ] Telecommunication included a small deep space transponder on the descent stage and a solid-state power amplifier on the rover for X-band . The rover also has two UHF radios, [ 27 ] the signals of which orbiting relay satellites are capable of relaying back to Earth. Signals between Earth and Mars take an average of 14 minutes, 6 seconds. [ 46 ] Curiosity can communicate with Earth directly at speeds up to 32 kbit/s, but the bulk of the data transfer is being relayed through the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Odyssey orbiter . Data transfer speeds between Curiosity and each orbiter may reach 2000 kbit/s and 256 kbit/s, respectively, but each orbiter is able to communicate with Curiosity for only about eight minutes per day (0.56% of the time). [ 47 ] Communication from and to Curiosity relies on internationally agreed space data communications protocols as defined by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems . [ 48 ] Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is the central data distribution hub where selected data products are provided to remote science operations sites as needed. JPL is also the central hub for the uplink process, though participants are distributed at their respective home institutions. [ 27 ] At landing, telemetry was monitored by three orbiters, depending on their dynamic location: the 2001 Mars Odyssey , Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and ESA's Mars Express satellite. [ 49 ] As of February 2019, the MAVEN orbiter is being positioned to serve as a relay orbiter while continuing its science mission. [ 50 ] Mobility systems [ edit ] Close-up view of a well-worn wheel on the surface, which also shows the Morse code pattern for JPL. Mobility systems : Curiosity is equipped with six 50 cm (20 in) diameter wheels in a rocker-bogie suspension. These are scaled versions of those used on Mars Exploration Rovers (MER). [ 27 ] The suspension system also served as landing gear for the vehicle, unlike its smaller predecessors. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Each wheel has cleats and is independently actuated and geared, providing for climbing in soft sand and scrambling over rocks. Each front and rear wheel can be independently steered, allowing the vehicle to turn in place as well as execute arcing turns. [ 27 ] Each wheel has a pattern that helps it maintain traction but also leaves patterned tracks in the sandy surface of Mars. That pattern is used by on-board cameras to estimate the distance traveled. The pattern itself is Morse code for "JPL" (·--- ·--· ·-··). [ 53 ] The rover is capable of climbing sand dunes with slopes up to 12.5°. [ 54 ] Based on the center of mass , the vehicle can withstand a tilt of at least 50° in any direction without overturning, but automatic sensors limit the rover from exceeding 30° tilts. [ 27 ] After six years of use, the wheels are visibly worn with punctures and tears. [ 55 ] Curiosity can roll over obstacles approaching 65 cm (26 in) in height, [ 26 ] and it has a ground clearance of 60 cm (24 in). [ 56 ] Based on variables including power levels, terrain difficulty, slippage and visibility, the maximum terrain-traverse speed is estimated to be 200 m (660 ft) per day by automatic navigation. [ 26 ] The rover landed about 10 km (6.2 mi) from the base of Mount Sharp , [ 57 ] (officially named Aeolis Mons ) and it is expected to traverse a minimum of 19 km (12 mi) during its primary two-year mission. [ 58 ] It can travel up to 90 m (300 ft) per hour but average speed is about 30 m (98 ft) per hour. [ 58 ] The vehicle is 'driven' by several operators led by Vandi Verma , group leader of Autonomous Systems, Mobility and Robotic Systems at JPL, [ 59 ] [ 60 ] who also cowrote the PLEXIL language used to operate the rover. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] Landing [ edit ] Further information: Bradbury Landing Descent of Curiosity (video-02:26; August 6, 2012) Curiosity landed in Quad 51 (nicknamed Yellowknife ) of Aeolis Palus in the crater Gale. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] The landing site coordinates are: 4°35′22″S 137°26′30″E ﻿ / ﻿ 4.5895°S 137.4417°E ﻿ / -4.5895; 137.4417 . [ 68 ] [ 69 ] The location was named Bradbury Landing on August 22, 2012, in honor of science fiction author Ray Bradbury . [ 6 ] Gale, an estimated 3.5 to 3.8 billion-year-old impact crater, is hypothesized to have first been gradually filled in by sediments ; first water-deposited, and then wind-deposited, possibly until it was completely covered. Wind erosion then scoured out the sediments, leaving an isolated 5.5 km (3.4 mi) mountain, Aeolis Mons ("Mount Sharp"), at the center of the 154 km (96 mi) wide crater. Thus, it is believed that the rover may have the opportunity to study two billion years of Martian history in the sediments exposed in the mountain. Additionally, its landing site is near an alluvial fan , which is hypothesized to be the result of a flow of ground water, either before the deposition of the eroded sediments or else in relatively recent geologic history. [ 70 ] [ 71 ] According to NASA, an estimated 20,000 to 40,000 heat-resistant bacterial spores were on Curiosity at launch, and as many as 1,000 times that number may not have been counted. [ 72 ] Rover's landing system [ edit ] Main article: Mars Science Laboratory–Landing NASA video describing the landing procedure. NASA dubbed the landing as "Seven Minutes of Terror" Previous NASA Mars rovers became active only after the successful entry, descent and landing on the Martian surface. Curiosity , on the other hand, was active when it touched down on the surface of Mars, employing the rover suspension system for the final set-down. [ 73 ] Curiosity transformed from its stowed flight configuration to a landing configuration while the MSL spacecraft simultaneously lowered it beneath the spacecraft descent stage with a 20 m (66 ft) tether from the " sky crane " system to a soft landing – wheels down – on the surface of Mars. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] After the rover touched down it waited two seconds to confirm that it was on solid ground then fired several pyrotechnic fasteners activating cable cutters on the bridle to free itself from the spacecraft descent stage. The descent stage then flew away to a crash landing, and the rover prepared itself to begin the science portion of the mission. [ 78 ] Travel status [ edit ] As of August 16, 2024, the rover has driven 35.5 km (22.1 mi) from its landing site over 4818 sols (Martian days). [ 20 ] Duplicate testing rovers [ edit ] MAGGIE Rover Scarecrow rover Curiosity has two full sized, vehicle system test beds (VSTB), a twin rover used for testing and problem solving, MAGGIE rover (Mars Automated Giant Gizmo for Integrated Engineering) with a computer brain and a Scarecrow rover without a computer brain. They are housed at the JPL Mars Yard for problem solving on simulated Mars terrain. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] Scientific instruments [ edit ] Instrument location diagram The general sample analysis strategy begins with high-resolution cameras to look for features of interest. If a particular surface is of interest, Curiosity can vaporize a small portion of it with an infrared laser and examine the resulting spectra signature to query the rock's elemental composition. If that signature is intriguing, the rover uses its long arm to swing over a microscope and an X-ray spectrometer to take a closer look. If the specimen warrants further analysis, Curiosity can drill into the boulder and deliver a powdered sample to either the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) or the CheMin analytical laboratories inside the rover. [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] The MastCam, Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI), and Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) cameras were developed by Malin Space Science Systems and they all share common design components, such as on-board digital image processing boxes, 1600 × 1200 charge-coupled device (CCDs), and an RGB Bayer pattern filter . [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 25 ] [ 88 ] In total, the rover carries 17 cameras: HazCams (8), NavCams (4), MastCams (2), MAHLI (1), MARDI (1), and ChemCam (1). [ 89 ] Mast Camera (Mastcam) [ edit ] The turret at the end of the robotic arm holds five devices. The Mastcam system provides multiple spectra and true-color imaging with two cameras. [ 85 ] The cameras can take true-color images at 1600×1200 pixels and up to 10 frames per second hardware-compressed video at 720p (1280×720). [ 90 ] One Mastcam camera is the Medium Angle Camera (MAC; also referred to as Mastcam-34 and Mastcam-Left), which has a 34 mm (1.3 in) focal length , a 15° field of view , and can yield 22 cm/pixel (8.7 in/pixel) scale at 1 km (0.62 mi). The other camera in the Mastcam is the Narrow Angle Camera (NAC; also Mastcam-100 and Mastcam-Right), which has a 100 mm (3.9 in) focal length, a 5.1° field of view, and can yield 7.4 cm/pixel (2.9 in/pixel) scale at 1 km (0.62 mi). [ 85 ] Malin also developed a pair of Mastcams with zoom lenses, [ 91 ] but these were not included in the rover because of the time required to test the new hardware and the looming November 2011 launch date. [ 92 ] However, the improved zoom version was selected to be incorporated on the Mars 2020 mission as Mastcam-Z . [ 93 ] Each camera has eight gigabytes of flash memory, which is capable of storing over 5,500 raw images, and can apply real time lossless data compression . [ 85 ] The cameras have an autofocus capability that allows them to focus on objects from 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in) to infinity. [ 25 ] In addition to the fixed RGBG Bayer pattern filter, each camera has an eight-position filter wheel. While the Bayer filter reduces visible light throughput, all three colors are mostly transparent at wavelengths longer than 700 nm, and have minimal effect on such infrared observations. [ 85 ] Chemistry and Camera complex (ChemCam) [ edit ] Main article: Chemistry and Camera complex The internal spectrometer (left) and the laser telescope (right) for the mast First laser spectrum of chemical elements from ChemCam on Curiosity ( "Coronation" rock , August 19, 2012) ChemCam is a suite of two remote sensing instruments combined as one: a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and a Remote Micro Imager (RMI) telescope. The ChemCam instrument suite was developed by the French CESR laboratory and the Los Alamos National Laboratory . [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 96 ] The flight model of the mast unit was delivered from the French CNES to Los Alamos National Laboratory . [ 97 ] The purpose of the LIBS instrument is to provide elemental compositions of rock and regolith, while the RMI gives ChemCam scientists high-resolution images of the sampling areas of the rocks and regolith that LIBS targets. [ 94 ] [ 98 ] The LIBS instrument can target a rock or regolith sample up to 7 m (23 ft) away, vaporizing a small amount of it with about 50 to 75 5-nanosecond pulses from a 1067 nm infrared laser and then observes the spectrum of the light emitted by the vaporized rock. [ 99 ] ChemCam has the ability to record up to 6,144 different wavelengths of ultraviolet , visible , and infrared light. [ 100 ] Detection of the ball of luminous plasma is done in the visible, near-UV and near-infrared ranges, between 240 nm and 800 nm. [ 94 ] The first initial laser testing of the ChemCam by Curiosity on Mars was performed on a rock, N165 ("Coronation" rock) , near Bradbury Landing on August 19, 2012. [ 101 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ] The ChemCam team expects to take approximately one dozen compositional measurements of rocks per day. [ 104 ] Using the same collection optics, the RMI provides context images of the LIBS analysis spots. The RMI resolves 1 mm (0.039 in) objects at 10 m (33 ft) distance, and has a field of view covering 20 cm (7.9 in) at that distance. [ 94 ] Navigation cameras (Navcams) [ edit ] Main article: Navcam First full-resolution Navcam images The rover has two pairs of black and white navigation cameras mounted on the mast to support ground navigation. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] The cameras have a 45° angle of view and use visible light to capture stereoscopic 3-D imagery . [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) [ edit ] Main article: Rover Environmental Monitoring Station REMS comprises instruments to measure the Mars environment: humidity, pressure, temperatures, wind speeds, and ultraviolet radiation. [ 108 ] It is a meteorological package that includes an ultraviolet sensor provided by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science . The investigative team is led by Javier Gómez-Elvira of the Spanish Astrobiology Center and includes the Finnish Meteorological Institute as a partner. [ 109 ] [ 110 ] All sensors are located around three elements: two booms attached to the rover's mast, the Ultraviolet Sensor (UVS) assembly located on the rover top deck, and the Instrument Control Unit (ICU) inside the rover body. REMS provides new clues about the Martian general circulation, micro scale weather systems, local hydrological cycle, destructive potential of UV radiation, and subsurface habitability based on ground-atmosphere interaction. [ 109 ] Hazard avoidance cameras (Hazcams) [ edit ] Main article: Hazcam The rover has four pairs of black and white navigation cameras called hazcams , two pairs in the front and two pairs in the back. [ 105 ] [ 111 ] They are used for autonomous hazard avoidance during rover drives and for safe positioning of the robotic arm on rocks and regolith. [ 111 ] Each camera in a pair is hardlinked to one of two identical main computers for redundancy; only four out of the eight cameras are in use at any one time. The cameras use visible light to capture stereoscopic three-dimensional (3-D) imagery. [ 111 ] The cameras have a 120° field of view and map the terrain at up to 3 m (9.8 ft) in front of the rover. [ 111 ] This imagery safeguards against the rover crashing into unexpected obstacles, and works in tandem with software that allows the rover to make its own safety choices. [ 111 ] Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) [ edit ] Main article: Mars Hand Lens Imager Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) MAHLI is a camera on the rover's robotic arm, and acquires microscopic images of rock and regolith. MAHLI can take true-color images at 1600×1200 pixels with a resolution as high as 14.5 µm per pixel. MAHLI has an 18.3 to 21.3 mm (0.72 to 0.84 in) focal length and a 33.8–38.5° field of view. [ 86 ] MAHLI has both white and ultraviolet Light-emitting diode (LED) illumination for imaging in darkness or fluorescence imaging. MAHLI also has mechanical focusing in a range from infinite to millimeter distances. [ 86 ] This system can make some images with focus stacking processing. [ 112 ] MAHLI can store either the raw images or do real time lossless predictive or JPEG compression. The calibration target for MAHLI includes color references, a metric bar graphic, a 1909 VDB Lincoln penny, and a stair-step pattern for depth calibration. [ 113 ] Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) [ edit ] See also: Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer The APXS instrument irradiates samples with alpha particles and maps the spectra of X-rays that are re-emitted for determining the elemental composition of samples. [ 114 ] Curiosity 's APXS was developed by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). [ 114 ] MacDonald Dettwiler (MDA) , the Canadian aerospace company that built the Canadarm and RADARSAT , were responsible for the engineering design and building of the APXS. The APXS science team includes members from the University of Guelph , the University of New Brunswick , the University of Western Ontario , NASA , the University of California, San Diego and Cornell University . [ 115 ] The APXS instrument takes advantage of particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and X-ray fluorescence , previously exploited by the Mars Pathfinder and the two Mars Exploration Rovers . [ 114 ] [ 116 ] Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) [ edit ] Main article: CheMin Curiosity 's CheMin Spectrometer on Mars (September 11, 2012), with sample inlet seen closed and open First X-ray diffraction view of Martian regolith ( Curiosity at Rocknest , October 17, 2012) [ 117 ] CheMin is the Chemistry and Mineralogy X-ray powder diffraction and fluorescence instrument. [ 118 ] CheMin is one of four spectrometers . It can identify and quantify the abundance of the minerals on Mars. It was developed by David Blake at NASA Ames Research Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , [ 119 ] and won the 2013 NASA Government Invention of the year award. [ 120 ] The rover can drill samples from rocks and the resulting fine powder is poured into the instrument via a sample inlet tube on the top of the vehicle. A beam of X-rays is then directed at the powder and the crystal structure of the minerals deflects it at characteristic angles, allowing scientists to identify the minerals being analyzed. [ 121 ] On October 17, 2012, at " Rocknest ", the first X-ray diffraction analysis of Martian regolith was performed. The results revealed the presence of several minerals, including feldspar , pyroxenes and olivine , and suggested that the Martian regolith in the sample was similar to the "weathered basaltic soils " of Hawaiian volcanoes . [ 117 ] The paragonetic tephra from a Hawaiian cinder cone has been mined to create Martian regolith simulant for researchers to use since 1998. [ 122 ] [ 123 ] CheMin eventually found carbonates in the form of crystalline siderite (FeCO 3 ).  One rock contained over 10 % of the mineral.  Some rocks also were composed of plagioclase with the elements sodium (Na)–, Ca-, and aluminum (Al)–, as well as  Ca- and Mg-bearing silicate mineral pyroxene.   Other minerals found were calcium sulfates, magnesium sulfates, different amounts of iron oxyhydroxides, and an unidentified x-ray amorphous material.  Rover's Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instrument uses x-ray diffraction to determine sample mineralogy.  The names of the rock formations and drill sites are CA, Canaima; TC, Tapo Caparo; UB, Ubajara; and SQ, Sequoia. V [ 124 ] Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) [ edit ] Main article: Sample Analysis at Mars First night-time pictures on Mars (white-light left/ UV right) ( Curiosity viewing Sayunei rock, January 22, 2013) The SAM instrument suite analyzes organics and gases from both atmospheric and solid samples. It consists of instruments developed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center , the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory the Laboratoire atmosphères, milieux, observations spatiales (LATMOS), the Laboratoire Inter-Universitaire des Systèmes Atmosphériques (LISA) (jointly operated by France's CNRS and Parisian universities), and Honeybee Robotics , along with many additional external partners. [ 82 ] [ 125 ] [ 126 ] The three main instruments are a Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QMS), a gas chromatograph (GC) and a tunable laser spectrometer (TLS) . These instruments perform precision measurements of oxygen and carbon isotope ratios in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) in the atmosphere in order to distinguish between their geochemical or biological origin. [ 82 ] [ 126 ] [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Dust Removal Tool (DRT) [ edit ] First use of Curiosity 's Dust Removal Tool (DRT) (January 6, 2013); Ekwir_1 rock before/after cleaning (left) and closeup (right) The Dust Removal Tool (DRT) is a motorized, wire-bristle brush on the turret at the end of Curiosity 's arm. The DRT was first used on a rock target named Ekwir_1 on January 6, 2013. Honeybee Robotics built the DRT. [ 129 ] Radiation assessment detector (RAD) [ edit ] Main article: Radiation assessment detector The role of the Radiation assessment detector (RAD) instrument is to characterize the broad spectrum of radiation environment found inside the spacecraft during the cruise phase and while on Mars. These measurements have never been done before from the inside of a spacecraft in interplanetary space. Its primary purpose is to determine the viability and shielding needs for potential human explorers, as well as to characterize the radiation environment on the surface of Mars, which it started doing immediately after MSL landed in August 2012. [ 130 ] Funded by the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters and Germany's Space Agency ( DLR ), RAD was developed by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and the extraterrestrial physics group at Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel , Germany. [ 130 ] [ 131 ] Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) [ edit ] Main article: Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons The DAN instrument employs a neutron source and detector for measuring the quantity and depth of hydrogen or ice and water at or near the Martian surface. [ 132 ] The instrument consists of the detector element (DE) and a 14.1 MeV pulsing neutron generator (PNG). The die-away time of neutrons is measured by the DE after each neutron pulse from the PNG.
DAN was provided by the Russian Federal Space Agency [ 133 ] [ 134 ] and funded by Russia. [ 135 ] Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) [ edit ] MARDI camera MARDI is fixed to the lower front left corner of the body of Curiosity . During the descent to the Martian surface, MARDI took color images at 1600×1200 pixels with a 1.3-millisecond exposure time starting at distances of about 3.7 km (2.3 mi) to near 5 m (16 ft) from the ground, at a rate of four frames per second for about two minutes. [ 87 ] [ 136 ] MARDI has a pixel scale of 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) at 2 km (1.2 mi) to 1.5 mm (0.059 in) at 2 m (6 ft 7 in) and has a 90° circular field of view. MARDI has eight gigabytes of internal buffer memory that is capable of storing over 4,000 raw images. MARDI imaging allowed the mapping of surrounding terrain and the location of landing. [ 87 ] JunoCam , built for the Juno spacecraft , is based on MARDI. [ 137 ] Robotic arm [ edit ] First use of Curiosity 's scooper as it sifts a load of sand at Rocknest (October 7, 2012) First drill tests ( John Klein rock , Yellowknife Bay , February 2, 2013). [ 138 ] The rover has a 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in) long robotic arm with a cross-shaped turret holding five devices that can spin through a 350° turning range. [ 139 ] [ 140 ] The arm makes use of three joints to extend it forward and to stow it again while driving. It has a mass of 30 kg (66 lb) and its diameter, including the tools mounted on it, is about 60 cm (24 in). [ 141 ] It was designed, built, and tested by MDA US Systems , building upon their prior robotic arm work on the Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander , the Phoenix lander, and the two Mars Exploration Rovers , Spirit and Opportunity . [ 142 ] Two of the five devices are in-situ or contact instruments known as the X-ray spectrometer (APXS), and the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI camera). The remaining three are associated with sample acquisition and sample preparation functions: a percussion drill ; a brush; and mechanisms for scooping, sieving, and portioning samples of powdered rock and regolith. [ 139 ] [ 141 ] The diameter of the hole in a rock after drilling is 1.6 cm (0.63 in) and up to 5 cm (2.0 in) deep. [ 140 ] [ 143 ] The drill carries two spare bits. [ 143 ] [ 144 ] The rover's arm and turret system can place the APXS and MAHLI on their respective targets, and also obtain powdered sample from rock interiors, and deliver them to the SAM and CheMin analyzers inside the rover. [ 140 ] Since early 2015 the percussive mechanism in the drill that helps chisel into rock has had an intermittent electrical short. [ 145 ] On December 1, 2016, the motor inside the drill caused a malfunction that prevented the rover from moving its robotic arm and driving to another location. [ 146 ] The fault was isolated to the drill feed brake, [ 147 ] and internal debris is suspected of causing the problem. [ 145 ] By December 9, 2016, driving and robotic arm operations were cleared to continue, but drilling remained suspended indefinitely. [ 148 ] The Curiosity team continued to perform diagnostics and testing on the drill mechanism throughout 2017, [ 149 ] and resumed drilling operations on May 22, 2018. [ 150 ] Media, cultural impact and legacy [ edit ] Further information: Timeline of Mars Science Laboratory § Current status Celebration erupts at NASA with the rover's successful landing on Mars (August 6, 2012). Live video showing the first footage from the surface of Mars was available at NASA TV , during the late hours of August 6, 2012, PDT, including interviews with the mission team. The NASA website momentarily became unavailable from the overwhelming number of people visiting it, [ 151 ] and a 13-minute NASA excerpt of the landings on its YouTube channel was halted an hour after the landing by an automated copyright takedown notice from Scripps Local News , which prevented access for several hours. [ 152 ] Around 1,000 people gathered in New York City's Times Square , to watch NASA's live broadcast of Curiosity 's landing, as footage was being shown on the giant screen. [ 153 ] Bobak Ferdowsi , Flight Director for the landing, became an Internet meme and attained Twitter celebrity status, with 45,000 new followers subscribing to his Twitter account, due to his Mohawk hairstyle with yellow stars that he wore during the televised broadcast. [ 154 ] [ 155 ] On August 13, 2012, U.S. President Barack Obama , calling from aboard Air Force One to congratulate the Curiosity team, said, "You guys are examples of American know-how and ingenuity. It's really an amazing accomplishment". [ 156 ] ( Video (07:20) Archived May 21, 2013, at the Wayback Machine ) Scientists at the Getty Conservation Institute in Los Angeles, California, viewed the CheMin instrument aboard Curiosity as a potentially valuable means to examine ancient works of art without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. CheMin directs a beam of X-rays at particles as small as 400 μm (0.016 in) [ 157 ] and reads the radiation scattered back to determine the composition of the artifact in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version named the X-Duetto . Fitting into a few briefcase -sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, while preserving their physical integrity. It is now being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum antiques and the Roman ruins of Herculaneum , Italy. [ 158 ] Prior to the landing, NASA and Microsoft released Mars Rover Landing , a free downloadable game on Xbox Live that uses Kinect to capture body motions, which allows users to simulate the landing sequence. [ 159 ] U.S. flag medallion Plaque with President Obama and Vice President Biden 's signatures NASA gave the general public the opportunity from 2009 until 2011 to submit their names to be sent to Mars. More than 1.2 million people from the international community participated, and their names were etched into silicon using an electron-beam machine used for fabricating micro devices at JPL , and this plaque is now installed on the deck of Curiosity . [ 160 ] In keeping with a 40-year tradition, a plaque with the signatures of President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden was also installed. Elsewhere on the rover is the autograph of Clara Ma, the 12-year-old girl from Kansas who gave Curiosity its name in an essay contest, writing in part that "curiosity is the passion that drives us through our everyday lives". [ 161 ] On August 6, 2013, Curiosity audibly played " Happy Birthday to You " in honor of the one Earth year mark of its Martian landing, the first time for a song to be played on another planet. This was also the first time music was transmitted between two planets. [ 162 ] On June 24, 2014, Curiosity completed a Martian year – 687 Earth days – after finding that Mars once had environmental conditions favorable for microbial life . [ 163 ] Curiosity served as the basis for the design of the Perseverance rover for the Mars 2020 rover mission . Some spare parts from the build and ground test of Curiosity are being used in the new vehicle, but it will carry a different instrument payload. [ 164 ] In 2014, project chief engineer wrote a book detailing the development of the Curiosity rover. "Mars Rover Curiosity: An Inside Account from Curiosity's Chief Engineer," is a firsthand account of the development and landing of the Curiosity Rover. On August 5, 2017, NASA celebrated the fifth anniversary of the Curiosity rover mission landing, and related exploratory accomplishments, on the planet Mars . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] (Videos: Curiosity 's First Five Years (02:07) ; Curiosity 's POV: Five Years Driving (05:49) ; Curiosity 's Discoveries About Gale Crater (02:54) ) As reported in 2018, drill samples taken in 2015 uncovered organic molecules of benzene and propane in 3 billion year old rock samples in Gale. [ 165 ] [ 166 ] [ 167 ] In popular culture, the launch of Curiosity is referenced in the music video for Harry Styles ' 2023 song, " Satellite ". [ 168 ] In March 2024 it was published that Curiosity discovered long chain alkanes with up to 12 consecutive carbon atoms, in mudstone in Gale crater. The origin of these molecules is unknown. They could be derived from either abiotic or biological sources. [ 169 ] Images [ edit ] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Curiosity rover .

Built and managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , it was launched on July 30, 2020, [ 5 ] from Cape Canaveral aboard an Atlas V rocket and landed in Jezero Crater , a site chosen for its ancient river delta that may preserve evidence of past microbial life . The rover's main goals are to search for signs of ancient life, study the planet's geology and climate, and collect rock and regolith samples for possible return to Earth by a future mission. Perseverance also tests technologies intended to support later human exploration , including an experiment that successfully produced oxygen from the thin carbon-dioxide atmosphere. [ 6 ] Perseverance carries seven primary scientific instruments, 19 cameras, and two microphones. [ 7 ] It also deployed the experimental helicopter Ingenuity , which in April 2021 performed the first powered and controlled flight on another planet. [ 8 ] Originally intended for up to five flights, Ingenuity completed dozens of sorties before being retired in 2024. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator , Perseverance has an expected mission duration of over a decade. [ 11 ] It has provided high-resolution panoramas, drilled and cached samples for later retrieval, and identified rocks which may have been habitable for ancient microbial life in Jezero Crater. In July 2024, it discovered the Cheyava Falls rock containing "possible biosignature ". As of January 5, 2026 [update] , the rover has been active on Mars for 1,734 sols (1,782 Earth days). Mission [ edit ] Despite the high-profile success of the Curiosity rover landing in August 2012, NASA's Mars Exploration Program was in a state of uncertainty in the early 2010s. Budget cuts forced NASA to pull out of a planned collaboration with the European Space Agency which included a rover mission. [ 12 ] By the summer of 2012, a program that had been launching a mission to Mars every two years suddenly found itself with no missions approved after 2013. [ 13 ] In 2011, the Planetary Science Decadal Survey , a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine containing an influential set of recommendations made by the planetary science community, stated that the top priority of NASA's planetary exploration program in the decade between 2013 and 2022 should be to begin a NASA-ESA Mars Sample Return campaign, a four-mission project to cache, retrieve, launch, and safely return samples of the Martian surface to Earth. The report stated that NASA should invest in a sample-caching rover as the first step in this effort, with the goal of keeping costs under US$2.5 billion. [ 14 ] After the success of the Curiosity rover and in response to the recommendations of the decadal survey, NASA announced its intent to launch a new Mars rover mission by 2020 at the American Geophysical Union conference in December 2012. [ 15 ] Though initially hesitant to commit to an ambitious sample-caching capability (and subsequent follow-on missions), a NASA-convened science definition team for the Mars 2020 project released a report in July 2013 that the mission should "select and store a compelling suite of samples in a returnable cache." [ 16 ] Science objectives [ edit ] The Perseverance rover has four main science objectives [ 17 ] that support the Mars Exploration Program 's science goals: [ 6 ] Looking for habitability: identify past environments that were capable of supporting microbial life . Seeking biosignatures : seek signs of possible past microbial life in those habitable environments, particularly in specific rock types known to preserve signs over time. Caching samples: collect core rock and regolith (unconsolidated and loose "soil") samples and store them within the rover and on the Martian surface (as a backup) for delivery to a future sample return rocket. [ 18 ] Preparing for humans: test oxygen production from the Martian atmosphere . In the first science campaign, dubbed "Crater Floor", Perseverance performed an arching drive southward from its landing site to the Séítah unit to perform a "toe dip" into the unit to collect remote-sensing measurements of geologic targets. After that it returned to the Crater Floor Fractured Rough to collect the first core sample there. Passing by the Octavia E. Butler landing site concluded the first science campaign. The second campaign, "Fan Front", included several months of travel towards the "Three Forks" where Perseverance accessed geologic locations at the base of the ancient delta of Neretva river, as well as ascending the delta by driving up a valley wall to the northwest. [ 19 ] The third and fourth campaigns were called "Upper Fan", and "Margin Unit", and the fifth campaign, "Northern Rim", in progress as of December 2024, is exploring "the northern part of the southwestern section of Jezero's rim" to study "rocks from deep down inside Mars that were thrown upward to form the crater rim" after the impact 3.9 billion years ago that formed Jezero Crater. [ 20 ] Results [ edit ] The scientific results, as of 2025, are as follows. According to NASA, the mission has made "discoveries about the volcanic history, habitability, and role of water in Jezero Crater." [ 21 ] Specifically, they reported that instead of all the rocks in Jezero crater being sedimentary, being "transported into the crater by wind or water," "several types of igneous rock" were discovered, which "showed evidence of interaction with water." [ 21 ] Additionally, At a rock named "Wildcat Ridge" located within Jezero's well-preserved sedimentary fan deposit, Perseverance found evidence for an ancient lake environment. Not only were these sediments likely deposited in a standing body of water, but they also continued to interact with water long after they were formed. The environments recorded within the rocks at Wildcat Ridge would have been habitable for ancient microbial life, and this type of rock is ideal for preserving possible signs of ancient life. [ 21 ] They also found that "sediments entering Jezero's lake were deposited in a delta" and  "evidence for late-stage, high-energy flooding that carried large boulders into the crater." [ 21 ] The MOXIE experiment produced 122 grams of oxygen from carbon dioxide. [ 21 ] The microphone studies showed that the speed of sound is slower and the volumes of sounds transmitted through the atmosphere is lower, than on Earth. [ 21 ] PIXL found that the Seitah formation and a rock at "Otis Peak" contained olivine, phosphates, sulfates, clays, carbonate minerals, silicate minerals, "augite pyroxene, feldspathic mesostasis, various Fe,Cr,Ti-spinels, and merrillite", perchlorate, feldspar, magnesite, siderite, oxides, as well as minerals with composition including magnesium, iron, chlorine, and sodium. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] RIMFAX revealed findings "consistent with a subsurface dominated by solid rock and mafic material" [ 24 ] and that "the crater floor experienced a period of erosion before the deposition of the overlying delta strata. The regularity and horizontality of the basal delta sediments observed in the radar cross sections indicate that they were deposited in a low-energy lake environment." [ 25 ] Design [ edit ] Perseverance in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory near Pasadena , California The Perseverance design evolved from its predecessor, the Curiosity rover . The two rovers share a similar body plan, landing system, cruise stage, and power system, but the design was improved in several ways for Perseverance . Engineers designed the rover wheels to be more robust than Curiosity 's wheels, which had sustained some damage . [ 26 ] Perseverance has thicker, more durable aluminum wheels, with reduced width and a greater diameter, 52.5 cm (20.7 in), than Curiosity 's 50 cm (20 in) wheels. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] The aluminum wheels are covered with cleats for traction and curved titanium spokes for springy support. [ 29 ] The heat shield for the rover was made out of phenolic-impregnated carbon ablator (PICA), to allow it to withstand up to 2,400 °F (1,320 °C) of heat. [ 30 ] Like Curiosity , the rover includes a robotic arm , although Perseverance ' s arm is longer and stronger, measuring 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in). The arm hosts an elaborate rock-coring and sampling mechanism to store geologic samples from the Martian surface in sterile caching tubes. [ 31 ] There is also a secondary arm hidden below the rover that helps store the chalk-sized samples. This arm is known as the Sample Handling Assembly (SHA), and is responsible for moving the soil samples to various stations within the Adaptive Caching Assembly (ACA) on the underside of the rover. These stations include volume assessment (measuring the length of sample), imaging, seal dispensing, and hermetic seal station, among others. [ 32 ] Owing to the small space in which the SHA must operate, as well as load requirements during sealing activities, the Sample Caching System "is the most complicated, most sophisticated mechanism that we have ever built, tested and readied for spaceflight." [ 33 ] The combination of larger instruments, new sampling and caching system, and modified wheels makes Perseverance heavier, weighing 1,025 kg (2,260 lb) compared to Curiosity at 899 kg (1,982 lb)—a 14% increase. [ 34 ] The rover's multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator ( MMRTG ) has a mass of 45 kg (99 lb) and uses 4.8 kg (11 lb) of plutonium-238 oxide as its power source. The radioactive decay of plutonium-238, which has a half-life of 87.7 years, gives off heat which is converted to electricity —approximately 110 watts at launch. [ 35 ] This will decrease over time as its power source decays. [ 35 ] The MMRTG charges two lithium-ion rechargeable batteries which power the rover's activities, and must be recharged periodically. Unlike solar panels , the MMRTG provides engineers with significant flexibility in operating the rover's instruments even at night, during dust storms , and through winter. [ 35 ] The rover's computer uses the BAE Systems RAD750 radiation-hardened single board computer based on a ruggedized PowerPC G3 microprocessor (PowerPC 750) . The computer contains 128 megabytes of volatile DRAM , and runs at 133 MHz. The flight software runs on the VxWorks operating system , is written in C and is able to access 4 gigabytes of NAND non-volatile memory on a separate card. [ 36 ] Perseverance relies on three antennas for telemetry , all of which are relayed through craft currently in orbit around Mars. The primary UHF antenna can send data from the rover at a maximum rate of two megabits per second. [ 37 ] Two slower X-band antennas provide communications redundancy. Instruments [ edit ] WATSON camera views rocks (Mars; video; 0:05; May 10, 2021) Sounds of Perseverance Mars rover driving While traveling the Jezero Crater, Perseverance recorded over 16 minutes of audio. [ 38 ] Problems playing this file? See media help . NASA considered nearly 60 proposals [ 39 ] [ 40 ] for rover instrumentation. On July 31, 2014, NASA announced the seven instruments that would make up the payload for the rover: [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE), an exploration technology investigation to produce a small amount of oxygen ( O 2 ) from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ). On April 20, 2021, 5.37 grams of oxygen were produced in an hour, with nine more extractions planned over the course of two Earth years to further investigate the instrument. [ 43 ] This technology could be scaled up in the future for human life support or to make the rocket fuel for return missions. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Planetary Instrument for X-Ray Lithochemistry (PIXL), an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer to determine the fine scale elemental composition of Martian surface materials. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Radar Imager for Mars' subsurface experiment (RIMFAX), a ground-penetrating radar to image different ground densities, structural layers, buried rocks, meteorites, and detect underground water ice and salty brine at 10 m (33 ft) depth. The RIMFAX is being provided by the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI). [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA), a set of sensors that measure temperature, wind speed and direction, pressure, relative humidity, radiation, and dust particle size and shape. It is provided by Spain 's Centro de Astrobiología . [ 53 ] SuperCam , an instrument suite that can provide imaging, chemical composition analysis, and mineralogy in rocks and regolith from a distance. It is an upgraded version of the ChemCam on the Curiosity rover but with two lasers and four spectrometers that will allow it to remotely identify biosignatures and assess the past habitability. SuperCam is used in conjunction with the AEGIS targeting system. Los Alamos National Laboratory , the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology (IRAP) in France , the French Space Agency ( CNES ), the University of Hawaii , and the University of Valladolid in Spain cooperated in the SuperCam's development and manufacture. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Mastcam-Z , a stereoscopic imaging system with the ability to zoom. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] Many photos were included in the published NASA photogallery . (Including Raw ) Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC), an ultraviolet Raman spectrometer that uses fine-scale imaging and an ultraviolet (UV) laser to determine fine-scale mineralogy and detect organic compounds . [ 58 ] [ 59 ] There are additional cameras and two audio microphones (the first working microphones on Mars), that will be used for engineering support during landing, [ 60 ] driving, and collecting samples.

Scientific instruments diagram Cameras documenting the descent and landing Cameras onboard the rover Mars Ingenuity helicopter experiment [ edit ] The Ingenuity helicopter, powered by solar-charged batteries, was sent to Mars in the same bundle with Perseverance . With a mass of 1.8 kg (4.0 lb), the helicopter demonstrated the reality of flight in the rarefied Martian atmosphere and the potential usefulness of aerial scouting for rover missions. It carried two cameras but no scientific instruments [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] and communicated with Earth via a base station onboard Perseverance . [ 66 ] Its pre-launch experimental test plan was three flights in 45 days, but it far exceeded expectations and made 72 flights in nearly three years. After its first few flights, it made incrementally more ambitious ones, several of which were recorded by Perseverance ' s cameras. The first flight was April 19, 2021, at 07:15 UTC, with confirmation from data reception at 10:15 UTC. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] It was the first powered flight by any aircraft on another planet. [ 8 ] On January 18, 2024 (UTC), it made its 72nd and final flight , suffering the loss of a rotor blade (imaged, by Perseverance , lying on the sand roughly 15 m (49 ft) distant from the upright body of Ingenuity ), causing NASA to retire it.

Zurbuchen made the final selection following a 2019 nationwide naming contest that drew more than 28,000 essays by K-12 students from every U.S. state and territory. Associate Administrator of NASA 's Science Mission Directorate Thomas Zurbuchen selected the name Perseverance following a nationwide K-12 student "name the rover" contest that attracted more than 28,000 proposals. A seventh-grade student, Alexander Mather from Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, Virginia , submitted the winning entry at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory . In addition to the honor of naming the rover, Mather and his family were invited to NASA's Kennedy Space Center to watch the rover's July 2020 launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) in Florida . [ 73 ] He was also joined at the launch by 11th grade student Vaneeza Rupani from Tuscaloosa County High School in Northport, Alabama , who named the Ingenuity helicopter that would fly with Perseverance . Mather wrote in his winning essay: Curiosity . InSight . Spirit . Opportunity . If you think about it, all of these names of past Mars rovers are qualities we possess as humans. We are always curious, and seek opportunity. We have the spirit and insight to explore the Moon, Mars, and beyond. But, if rovers are to be the qualities of us as a race, we missed the most important thing: Perseverance. We as humans evolved as creatures who could learn to adapt to any situation, no matter how harsh. We are a species of explorers, and we will meet many setbacks on the way to Mars. However, we can persevere. We, not as a nation but as humans, will not give up. The human race will always persevere into the future. [ 73 ] Twin rover [ edit ] The full-scale twin engineering model of Perseverance , the OPTIMISM rover is used at the JPL Mars Yard for testing procedures and solving problems [ a ] JPL built a copy of the Perseverance ; a twin rover used for testing and problem solving, OPTIMISM (Operational Perseverance Twin for Integration of Mechanisms and Instruments Sent to Mars), a vehicle system test bed (VSTB). It is housed at the JPL Mars Yard and is used to test operational procedures and to aid in problem solving should any issues arise with Perseverance . [ 74 ] Operational history [ edit ] Further information: Timeline of Mars 2020 Mars transit [ edit ] The Perseverance rover lifted off successfully on July 30, 2020, at 11:50:00 UTC aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V launch vehicle from Space Launch Complex 41 , at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) in Florida . [ 75 ] The rover took 29 weeks to travel to Mars and made its landing in Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021, to begin its science phase. [ 76 ] After May 17, 2022, the rover will move uphill and examine rocks on the surface for evidence of past life on Mars . On its return downhill, it will collect sample rocks to be retrieved and examined by future expeditions. [ 77 ] Landing [ edit ] The 6-m crater created with the impact of the 77-kg tungsten cruise mass balance device released during the EDL stage on February 18, 2021 The landing site and the spacecraft debris (February 2021) Octavia E. Butler Landing Site In Jezero Crater (March 5, 2021) Variants of routes as seen in March 2021 Map of Perseverance ' s Delta Top Campaign The successful landing of Perseverance in Jezero Crater was announced at 20:55 UTC on February 18, 2021, [ 3 ] the signal from Mars taking 11 minutes to arrive at Earth. The rover touched down at 18°26′41″N 77°27′03″E ﻿ / ﻿ 18.4446°N 77.4509°E ﻿ / 18.4446; 77.4509 , [ 78 ] roughly 1 km (0.62 mi) southeast of the center of its 7.7 km × 6.6 km (4.8 mi × 4.1 mi) [ 79 ] wide landing ellipse. It came down pointed almost directly to the southeast, [ 80 ] with the RTG on the back of the vehicle pointing northwest. The descent stage (" sky crane "), parachute and heat shield all came to rest within 1.5 km of the rover (see satellite image). Having come within five meters (16 ft) of its target, [ which? ] the landing was more accurate than any previous Mars landing; a feat enabled by the experience gained from Curiosity ' s landing and the use of new steering technology. [ 79 ] One such new technology is Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN), a technique in which the rover compares images of the surface taken during its descent with reference maps, allowing it to make last minute adjustments to its course. The rover also uses the images to select a safe landing site at the last minute, allowing it to land in relatively unhazardous terrain. This enables it to land much closer to its science objectives than previous missions, which all had to use a landing ellipse devoid of hazards. [ 79 ] The landing occurred in the late afternoon, with the first images taken at 15:53:58 on the mission clock (local mean solar time). [ 81 ] The landing took place shortly after Mars passed through its northern vernal equinox ( Ls = 5.2°), at the start of the astronomical spring, the equivalent of the end of March on Earth. [ 82 ] The parachute descent of the Perseverance rover was photographed by the HiRISE high-resolution camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). [ 83 ] Jezero Crater is a paleolake basin. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] It was selected as the landing site for this mission in part because paleolake basins tend to contain perchlorates . [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Astrobiologist Dr. Kennda Lynch's work in analog environments on Earth suggests that the composition of the crater, including the bottomset deposits accumulated from three different sources in the area, is a likely place to discover evidence of perchlorate-reducing microbes, if such bacteria are living or were formerly living on Mars. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Video of Perseverance' s parachute deployment and powered landing sequence Perseverance parachute descent over the Jezero crater photographed by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) An illustration of Perseverance tethered to the sky crane . The rover photographed from the sky crane during descent A few days after landing, Perseverance released the first audio recorded on the surface of Mars, capturing the sound of Martian wind . [ 86 ] [ 87 ] During its travels on Mars, NASA scientists had observed around Sol 341 (February 4, 2022) that a small rock had dropped into one of its wheels while the rover was studying the Máaz rock formation. The rock was visible from one of the hazard avoidance cameras, and was determined not to be harmful to the rover's mission. The rock has since stayed on Perseverance ' s wheel for around 427 sols (439 days) as the rover traveled over 6 miles (9.7 km) on the martian surface. NASA deemed that Perseverance had adopted a pet rock for its journey. [ 88 ] [ 89 ] [ 90 ] Later, by May 2024, the rover picked up another pet rock named "Dwayne". [ 91 ] Traverse [ edit ] Total tracks of Ingenuity and Perseverance November 10, 2023 [ 92 ] It is planned for Perseverance to visit the bottom and upper parts of the 3.4 to 3.8 billion-year-old Neretva Vallis delta, the smooth and etched parts of the Jezero Crater floor deposits interpreted as volcanic ash or aeolian airfall deposits, emplaced before the formation of the delta; the ancient shoreline covered with Transverse Aeolian Ridges (dunes) and mass wasting deposits, and finally, it is planned to climb onto the Jezero Crater rim. [ 93 ] In its progressive commissioning and tests, Perseverance made its first test drive on Mars on March 4, 2021. NASA released photographs of the rover's first wheel tracks on the Martian soil.

As of July 2025, [update] 33 out of 43 sample tubes have been filled, [ 95 ] including 8 igneous rock samples, 13 sedimentary rock sample tubes, 3 Igneous/ Impactite rock sample tubes, a Serpentinite rock sample tube, a Silica - cemented carbonate rock sample tube, [ 96 ] two regolith sample tubes, an atmosphere sample tube, [ 97 ] and three witness tubes. [ 98 ] Before launch, 5 of the 43 tubes were designated "witness tubes" and filled with materials that would capture particulates in the ambient environment of Mars. Out of 43 tubes, 3 witness sample tubes will not be returned to Earth and will remain on rover as the sample canister will only have 30 tube slots. Further, 10 of the 43 tubes are left as backups at the Three Forks Sample Depot. [ 99 ] Possible biosignature [ edit ] Main article: Cheyava Falls In July 2024, Perseverance discovered "leopard spots" on a reddish rock nicknamed "Cheyava Falls" in Mars' Jezero Crater , that has some indications it may have hosted microbial life billions of years ago, but further research is needed. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Cost [ edit ] NASA plans to invest roughly US$2.75 billion in the project over 11 years, including US$2.2 billion for the development and building of the hardware, US$243 million for launch services, and US$291 million for 2.5 years of mission operations. [ 7 ] [ 102 ] Adjusted for inflation, Perseverance is NASA's sixth-most expensive robotic planetary mission, though it is cheaper than its predecessor, Curiosity . [ 103 ] Perseverance benefited from spare hardware and "build-to print" designs from the Curiosity mission, which helped reduce development costs and saved "probably tens of millions, if not 100 million dollars" according to Mars 2020 Deputy Chief Engineer Keith Comeaux. [ 104 ] Commemorative artifacts [ edit ] "Send Your Name to Mars" [ edit ] See also: Europa Clipper § Public outreach NASA's "Send Your Name to Mars" campaign invited people from around the world to submit their names to travel aboard the agency's next rover to Mars. 10,932,295 names were submitted. The names were etched by an electron beam onto three fingernail-sized silicon chips, along with the essays of the 155 finalists in NASA's "Name the Rover" contest. The three chips share space on an anodized plate with a laser engraved graphic representing Earth, Mars, and the Sun. The rays emanating from the Sun contain the phrase "Explore As One" written in Morse code . [ 105 ] The plate was then mounted on the rover on March 26, 2020.

"Send Your Name" placard now on Mars (February 28, 2021) Geocaching in Space Trackable [ edit ] SHERLOC's calibration target aboard the Perseverance Mars rover with Mars Meteorite in the center of the top row Part of Perseverance ' s cargo is a geocaching trackable item viewable with the SHERLOC's WATSON camera. [ 108 ] In 2016, NASA SHERLOC co-investigator Dr. Marc Fries — with help from his son Wyatt — was inspired by Geocaching's 2008 placement of a cache on the International Space Station to set out and try something similar with the rover mission. After floating the idea around mission management, it eventually reached NASA scientist Francis McCubbin, who would join the SHERLOC instrument team as a collaborator to move the project forward. The Geocaching inclusion was scaled-down to a trackable item that players could search for from NASA camera views and then log on to the site. [ 109 ] In a manner similar to the "Send Your Name to Mars" campaign, the geocaching trackable code was carefully printed on a one-inch, polycarbonate glass disk serving as part of the rover's calibration target. It will serve as an optical target for the WATSON imager and a spectroscopic standard for the SHERLOC instrument. The disk is made of a prototype astronaut helmet visor material that will be tested for its potential use in crewed missions to Mars. Designs were approved by the mission leads at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), NASA Public Affairs, and NASA HQ, in addition to Groundspeak Geocaching HQ. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] Tribute to healthcare workers [ edit ] Tribute to Healthcare Workers plate seen before being attached to the rover. [ 107 ] Perseverance launched during the COVID-19 pandemic , which began to affect the mission planning in March 2020. To show appreciation for healthcare workers who helped during the pandemic, an 8 cm × 13 cm (3.1 in × 5.1 in) plate with a staff-and-serpent symbol (a Greek symbol of medicine) was placed on the rover. The project manager, Matt Wallace, said he hoped that future generations going to Mars would be able to appreciate healthcare workers during 2020. [ 112 ] Family portrait of NASA Mars rovers [ edit ] Family portrait on the rover. From left to right: Sojourner , Spirit , Opportunity , Curiosity , Perseverance and Ingenuity . [ 107 ] One of the external plates of Perseverance includes a simplified representation of all previous NASA Martian rovers, Sojourner , Spirit , Opportunity , Curiosity , as well as Perseverance and Ingenuity , similar to the trend of automobile window decals used to show a family's makeup. [ 113 ] Parachute with coded message [ edit ] Perseverance's parachute [ 107 ] The orange-and-white parachute used to land the rover on Mars contained a coded message that was deciphered by Twitter users. NASA's systems engineer Ian Clark used binary code to hide the message "dare mighty things" in the parachute color pattern. The 21-meter-wide (70 ft) parachute consisted of 80 strips of fabric that form a hemisphere-shape canopy, and each strip consisted of four pieces. Dr. Clark thus had 320 pieces with which to encode the message. He also included the GPS coordinates for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's headquarters in Pasadena, California (34°11'58" N 118°10'31" W). Clark said that only six people knew about the message before landing. The code was deciphered a few hours after the image was presented by Perseverance ' s team. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] "Dare mighty things" is a quote attributed to U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt and is the unofficial motto of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. [ 117 ] It adorns many of the JPL center's walls.

[ 1 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] It was manufactured by Lockheed Martin Space , was managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), [ 13 ] and two of its three scientific instruments were built by European agencies. [ 14 ] InSight confirmed " marsquakes " on the planet and thus a still active interior. The mission launched on 5 May 2018 at 11:05:01 UTC aboard an Atlas V -401 launch vehicle [ 15 ] and successfully landed [ 16 ] at Elysium Planitia on Mars on 26 November 2018 at 19:52:59 UTC. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 15 ] [ 19 ] InSight was active on Mars for 1440 sols (1480 days ; 4 years, 19 days). InSight 's objectives were to place a seismometer , called Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS), on the surface of Mars to measure seismic activity and provide accurate 3D models of the planet's interior; and measure internal heat transfer using a heat probe called HP 3 to study Mars's early geological evolution. [ 20 ] This was intended to provide a new understanding of how the Solar System's terrestrial planets – Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars – and Earth's Moon formed and evolved. The lander was originally planned for launch in March 2016. [ 12 ] [ 21 ] An instrument problem delayed the launch beyond the 2016 launch window . NASA officials rescheduled the InSight launch to May 2018 [ 22 ] and during the wait the instrument was repaired. This increased the total cost from US$675 million to US$830 million. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] InSight successfully landed on Mars on 26 November 2018. Due to excessive dust on its solar panels preventing it from recharging, NASA put InSight in low-power mode for detecting seismic events in July 2022 and continued monitoring the lander through the operational period ending in December 2022. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] On 20 December 2022, NASA announced that the InSight lander had lost communications with Earth on 15 December 2022, with the end of the mission being declared on 21 December 2022. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 27 ] History [ edit ] Discovery Program selection [ edit ] InSight comes together with the backshell and surface lander being joined, 2015. InSight was initially known as GEMS ( Geophysical Monitoring Station ), but its name was changed in early 2012 following a request by NASA. [ 28 ] Out of 28 proposals from 2010, [ 29 ] it was one of the three Discovery Program finalists receiving $3 million in May 2011 to develop a detailed concept study. [ 30 ] In August 2012, InSight was selected for development and launch. [ 12 ] Managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) with participation from scientists from several countries, the mission was cost-capped at US$425 million, not including launch vehicle funding. [ 31 ] By reusing the landing system designed for the Mars Phoenix lander , which successfully landed on Mars in 2008, mission costs and risks were reduced. [ 32 ] Schedule issues [ edit ] Lockheed Martin began construction of the lander on 19 May 2014, [ 33 ] with general testing starting on 27 May 2015. [ 34 ] A persistent vacuum leak in the CNES -supplied seismometer known as the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) led NASA to postpone the planned launch in March 2016 to May 2018. When InSight was delayed, the rest of the spacecraft was returned to Lockheed Martin's factory in Colorado for storage, and the Atlas V launch vehicle intended to launch the spacecraft was reassigned to the WorldView-4 mission. [ 35 ] On 9 March 2016, NASA officials announced that InSight would be delayed until the 2018 launch window at an estimated cost of US$150 million. [ 22 ] [ 36 ] The spacecraft was rescheduled to launch on 5 May 2018 for a Mars landing on 26 November 2018 at 20:00 UTC. The flight plan remained unchanged with launch using an Atlas V launch vehicle from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. [ 22 ] [ 36 ] NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory was tasked with redesigning and building a new vacuum enclosure for the SEIS instrument, while CNES conducted instrument integration and testing. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] On 22 November 2017, InSight completed testing in a thermal vacuum, also known as TVAC testing, where the spacecraft was put in simulated space conditions with reduced pressure and various thermal loads. [ 39 ] On 23 January 2018, after a long storage, its solar panels were once again deployed and tested, and a second silicon chip containing 1.6 million names from the public was added to the lander. [ 40 ] Effects of Martian dust and end of operations [ edit ] The InSight lander, powered by solar panels and batteries, relies on periodic wind gusts called " cleaning events " to reduce dust accumulation on the panels. Elysium Planitia, the landing site of InSight,  experienced fewer cleaning events than needed to keep science operations powered. In February 2021, at the start of the Martian winter, InSight's solar cells were producing 27% of capacity due to a thick covering of dust on the panels. At that time, NASA began the process of putting the lander into hibernation mode, shutting down data-gathering instruments on a schedule to conserve enough power to keep the lander electronics warm through the Martian winter. NASA had hoped that weather conditions would improve and allow InSight to store enough energy to come out of hibernation in July 2021. [ 41 ] In May 2021, some generation capacity was restored by using the arm to position sand so it could blow onto the solar panels and scour them clean. [ 42 ] NASA determined in May 2022 that there was too much dust on the panels to continue the mission. InSight was generating only one-tenth of the power from the sunlight than it did upon arrival. [ 26 ] They put the lander in a low-power mode in July 2022 to continue monitoring for seismic events. NASA continued to monitor InSight until the end of 2022, when the spacecraft missed two consecutive communication attempts. [ 27 ] Science background [ edit ] The Apollo 11 seismometer, 1969 Seismic vibrations [ edit ] Inside Mars InfoGraphic Mars InSight Lander (17 May 2022) Both Viking spacecraft carried seismometers mounted on their landers, and in 1976 vibrations were picked up from various lander operations and from the wind. [ 43 ] However, the Viking 1 lander's seismometer did not deploy properly and did not unlock; the locked seismometer could not operate. The Viking 2 seismometer unlocked; it operated and returned data to Earth. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] One problem was accounting for other data. On Sol 80, the Viking 2 seismometer detected an event. [ 45 ] No wind data were recorded at the same time, so it was not possible to determine whether the data indicated a seismic event or wind gust. Other lacking data would have been useful to rule out other sources of vibrations. [ 45 ] Two other problems were the location of the lander and that a certain level of wind on Mars caused a loss of sensitivity for the Viking 2 seismometer. [ 45 ] To overcome these and other issues, InSight had many other sensors, was placed directly on the surface, and also had a windshield. Despite the difficulties, the Viking 2 seismometer readings were used to estimate a Martian geological crust thickness between 14 and 18 km (8.7 and 11.2 mi) at the Viking 2 lander site. [ 46 ] The Viking 2 seismometer did detect vibrations from Mars winds complementing the meteorology results. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] There was the aforementioned candidate for a possible marsquake , but it was not particularly definitive. The wind data did prove useful in its own right, and despite the limitations of the data, widespread and large marsquakes were not detected. [ 48 ] Seismometers were also left on the Moon, starting with Apollo 11 in 1969, and also by Apollo 12 , 14 , 15 and 16 missions and provided many insights into lunar seismology , including the discovery of moonquakes . [ 49 ] [ 50 ] The Apollo seismic network, which was operated until 1977, detected at least 28 moonquakes up to 5.5 on the Richter scale . [ 51 ] One of the aspects of the InSight mission was to compare the Earth, Moon, and Mars seismic data. [ 52 ] Well, seismic investigation is really the heart of this mission. Seismology is the method that we've used to gain almost everything we know, all the basic information about the interior of the Earth, and we also used it back during the Apollo era to understand and to measure sort of the properties of the inside of the moon. And so, we want to apply the same techniques but use the waves that are generated by Mars quakes, by meteorite impacts to probe deep into the interior of Mars all the way down to its core. — Gravity Assist: Mars and InSight with Bruce Banerdt (3 May 2018) [ 52 ] On 4 May 2022, a large marsquake , estimated at magnitude 5, was detected by the seismometer on the InSight lander. [ 53 ] Mars quake detected (4 May 2022) On 25 October 2023, scientists, helped by information from InSight, reported that the planet Mars has a radioactive magma ocean under its crust. [ 54 ] Planetary precession [ edit ] Radio Doppler measurements were taken with Viking and twenty years later with Mars Pathfinder , and in each case the axis of rotation of Mars was estimated. By combining this data, the core size was constrained, because the change in axis of rotation over 20 years allowed a precession rate and from that the planet's moment of inertia to be estimated. [ 55 ] InSight 's measurements of crust thickness, mantle viscosity, core radius and density, and seismic activity were planned to result in a three- to tenfold increase in accuracy compared to previous data. [ 56 ] Objectives [ edit ] The InSight mission placed a single stationary lander on Mars to study its deep interior and address a fundamental issue of planetary and Solar System science: understanding the processes that shaped the rocky planets of the inner Solar System (including Earth) more than four billion years ago. [ 1 ] Comparison of the interiors of Earth, Mars and the Moon (artist concept) InSight 's primary objective was to study the earliest evolutionary processes that shaped Mars. By studying the size, thickness, density and overall structure of Mars's core , mantle and crust , as well as the rate at which heat escapes from the planet's interior, InSight was intended to provide a glimpse into the evolutionary processes of all of the rocky planets in the inner Solar System. [ 57 ] [ 1 ] The rocky inner planets share a common ancestry that begins with accretion . As the body increases in size, its interior heats up and evolves to become a terrestrial planet , containing a core, mantle and crust. [ 1 ] Despite this common ancestry, each of the terrestrial planets is later shaped and molded through the poorly understood process of differentiation . InSight mission's goal was to improve the understanding of this process and, by extension, terrestrial evolution, by measuring the planetary building blocks shaped by this differentiation: a terrestrial planet's core, mantle and crust. [ 1 ] InSight lander on Mars (artist concept) The mission was designed determine if there is any seismic activity , measure the rate of heat flow from the interior, estimate the size of Mars's core and establish whether the core is liquid or solid. [ 58 ] This data would be the first of its kind for Mars. [ 56 ] It was also expected that frequent meteor airbursts (10–200 detectable events per year for InSight ) would provide additional seismo-acoustic signals to probe the interior of Mars. [ 59 ] The mission's secondary objective was to conduct an in-depth study of geophysics , tectonic activity and the effect of meteorite impacts on Mars , which could provide knowledge about such processes on Earth. Measurements of crust thickness, mantle viscosity, core radius and density, and seismic activity should result in a three- to tenfold increase in accuracy compared to current data. [ 56 ] This was the first time a robotic lander dug this deep into the Martian crust. In terms of fundamental processes shaping planetary formation, it is thought that Mars contains the most in-depth and accurate historical record, because it is big enough to have undergone the earliest accretion and internal heating processes that shaped the terrestrial planets, but small enough to have retained signs of those processes. The science phase is expected to last for two years. [ 1 ] In March 2021, NASA reported, based on measurements of over 500 Marsquakes by the InSight lander on the planet Mars, that the core of Mars is between 1,810 and 1,860 km (1,120 and 1,160 mi), about half the size of the core of Earth , and significantly smaller than thought earlier, suggesting a core of lighter elements . [ 60 ] 2024 groundwater discovery [ edit ] See also: Groundwater on Mars In August 2024, a reservoir of liquid water was discovered on Mars – deep in the rocky outer crust of the planet. The findings came from a new analysis of data from Nasa's Mars Insight Lander, which recorded four years' of vibrations – Mars quakes – from deep inside the Red Planet. The analysis revealed reservoirs of water at depths of about six to 12 miles (10 to 20km) in the Martian crust. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] As per estimates, there may be enough water, trapped in tiny cracks and pores of rock in the middle of the Martian crust, to fill oceans on the planet's surface. The groundwater would likely cover the entirety of Mars to a depth of 1 mile (1.6 kilometers), the study found. [ 62 ] Design [ edit ] Artist's rendering of the InSight lander The mission further developed a design based on the 2008 Phoenix Mars lander. [ 63 ] Because InSight was powered by solar panels , it landed near the equator to enable maximum power for a projected lifetime of two years (1 Martian year ). [ 1 ] The mission included two relay microsatellites called Mars Cube One (MarCO) that launched with InSight but were flying in formation with InSight to Mars. [ 64 ] Three major aspects to the InSight spacecraft were the cruise stage , the entry, descent, and landing system , and the lander . [ 1 ] Overall specifications [ edit ] Mass Total mass during cruise: 694 kg (1,530 lb) [ 2 ] Lander: 358 kg (789 lb) [ 2 ] Aeroshell: 189 kg (417 lb) [ 2 ] Aeroshell Diameter (backshell and heat shield) : 2.64 meters (8.67 ft) [ 2 ] Cruise stage: 79 kg (174 lb) [ 2 ] Propellant and pressurant: 67 kg (148 lb) [ 2 ] Relay probes flew separately but they weighed 13.5 kg (30 lb) each (there were 2) [ 2 ] Lander specifications [ edit ] Lander mass: 358 kg (789 lb) [ 2 ] including about 50 kg of science payload. Mars weight (0.376 of Earth's): [ 65 ] 1,320 N (300 lbf) About 6.0 m (19.7 ft) wide with solar panels deployed. [ 2 ] The science deck is about 1.56 m (5.1 ft) wide and between 0.83 and 1.08 m (2.7 and 3.5 ft) high (depending on leg compression after landing). [ 2 ] The length of the robotic arm is 1.8 m (5.9 ft) [ 2 ] Tilt of lander at landing on Mars: 4° [ 66 ] Power [ edit ] Comparison of single-sol energy generated by various probes on Mars (30 November 2018) Power is generated by two round solar panels , each 2.15 m (7.1 ft) in diameter when unfurled, and consisting of SolAero ZTJ triple-junction solar cells made of InGaP / InGaAs / Ge arranged on Orbital ATK UltraFlex arrays. After touchdown on the Martian surface, the arrays are deployed by opening like a folding fan . [ 67 ] [ 68 ] Rechargeable batteries [ 69 ] Solar panels yielded 4.6 kilowatt-hours on Sol 1 [ 70 ] Payload [ edit ] The InSight lander with labeled instruments An animation of HP 3 mole burrowing into Mars InSight 's lander payload had a total mass of 50 kg (110 lb), including science instruments and support systems such as the Auxiliary Payload Sensor Suite, cameras, the instrument deployment system, and a laser retroreflector . [ 2 ] InSight performed three major experiments using SEIS, HP 3 and RISE. [ 71 ] SEIS is a very sensitive seismometer, measuring vibrations; HP 3 involves a burrowing probe to measure the thermal properties of the subsurface. [ 71 ] RISE uses the radio communication equipment on the lander and on Earth to measure the overall movement of planet Mars that could reveal the size and density of its core. The Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) measured marsquakes and other internal activity on Mars, and the response to meteorite impacts, to better understand the planet's history and structure. [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] SEIS was provided by the French Space Agency ( CNES ), with the participation of the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris ( IPGP ), the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ( ETH ), the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research ( MPS ), Imperial College , Institut supérieur de l'aéronautique et de l'espace ( ISAE ) and JPL. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] The seismometer can also detect sources including atmospheric waves and tidal forces from Mars's moon Phobos . [ 57 ] [ 77 ] A leak in SEIS in 2016 had forced a two-year mission postponement. [ 37 ] The SEIS instrument is supported by meteorological tools including a vector magnetometer provided by UCLA that measures magnetic disturbances, air temperature, wind speed and wind direction sensors based on the Spanish/Finnish Rover Environmental Monitoring Station ; and a barometer from JPL . [ 78 ] [ 55 ] The Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP 3 ), provided by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) included a radiometer and a heat flow probe. [ 77 ] [ 63 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] The probe, referred to as a "self-hammering nail" and nicknamed " the mole ", was designed to burrow 5 m (16 ft) below the Martian surface while trailing a tether, with embedded heat sensors to study the thermal properties of Mars's interior, and thus reveal unique information about the planet's geologic history. [ 77 ] [ 63 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] The hammering mechanism inside the mole was designed by the Polish company Astronika and the Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences under contract and in cooperation with DLR. [ 81 ] The tether contains precise temperature sensors every 10 cm (3.9 in) to measure the temperature profile of the subsurface. [ 77 ] [ 82 ] The Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment (RISE) led by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), was a radio science experiment that uses the lander's X band radio to provide precise measurements of planetary rotation to better understand the interior of Mars. [ 83 ] X band radio tracking, capable of an accuracy under 2 cm (0.79 in), builds on previous Viking program and Mars Pathfinder data. [ 77 ] The previous data allowed the core size to be estimated, but with more data from InSight , the nutation amplitude can be determined. [ 77 ] Once spin axis direction, precession, and nutation amplitudes are better understood, it should be possible to calculate the size and density of the Martian core and mantle . [ 77 ] This should increase the understanding of the formation of terrestrial planets (e.g. Earth) and rocky exoplanets . [ 77 ] Temperature and Winds for InSight (TWINS), fabricated by the Spanish Astrobiology Center , monitors weather at the landing site. [ 56 ] [ 78 ] Laser RetroReflector for InSight (LaRRI) is a corner cube retroreflector provided by the Italian Space Agency and mounted on InSight 's top deck. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] It enables passive laser range-finding by orbiters after the lander is retired, [ 86 ] and will function as a node in a proposed Mars geophysical network. [ 87 ] This device previously flew on the Schiaparelli lander as the Instrument for Landing-Roving Laser Retroreflector Investigations (INRRI), and is an aluminum dome 54 mm (2.1 in) in diameter and 25 g (0.9 oz) in mass featuring eight fused silica reflectors. [ 86 ] Instrument Deployment Arm (IDA) is a 1.8 m (5.9 ft) robotic arm that deployed the SEIS, wind and thermal shield, and HP 3 instruments to Mars's surface. [ 1 ] It is a 4 DOF motorized manipulator, constructed from carbon-fiber composite tubes. Originally intended for the canceled Mars Surveyor mission, the IDA features a scoop, wax actuated grappling claw, and the IDC camera. [ 88 ] [ 89 ] The Instrument Deployment Camera (IDC) is a color camera based on the Mars Exploration Rover and Mars Science Laboratory navcam design. It is mounted on the Instrument Deployment Arm and images the instruments on the lander's deck and provides stereoscopic views of the terrain surrounding the landing site. It features a 45° field of view and uses a 1024 × 1024 pixel CCD detector. [ 90 ] The IDC sensor was originally black and white for best resolution; a program was enacted that tested with a standard Hazcam and, since development deadlines and budgets were met, it was replaced with a color sensor. [ 91 ] The Instrument Context Camera (ICC) is a color camera based on the MER/MSL Hazcam design. It is mounted below the lander's deck, and with its wide-angle 120° panoramic field of view provides a complementary view of the instrument deployment area. Like the IDC, it uses a 1024 × 1024 pixel CCD detector. [ 90 ] A test of the 2.4 meter long Instrument Deployment Arm, seen deploying SEIS HP 3 on the lander deck on Sol 10 HP 3 diagram TWINS meteorological sensor LaRRI, the laser retroreflector on InSight 's deck The two relay 6U cubesats were part of the overall InSight program, and were launched at the same time as the lander but they were attached to the centaur upper stage (InSight's second stage in the launch). They were ejected from the stage after launch and coasted to Mars independent of the main InSight cruise stage with the lander. [ 92 ] Twin Lander [ edit ] JPL also built a full-scale engineering model, named ForeSight . This was used to practice instrument deployment, trial new ways to deploy the HP 3 instrument, and test methods to reduce seismometer noise. [ 93 ] With the mission now ended, the testbed is being scrapped and its parts will be offered to other teams such as the Mars Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL) for the Mars Sample Return campaign at JPL to be repurposed for their own needs. Anything that is not needed will go into storage. As of now, no attempt is planned to be undertaken to restore ForeSight or to send it to a museum. [ 94 ] Journey to Mars [ edit ] Launch [ edit ] On 28 February 2018, InSight was shipped via C-17 cargo aircraft from the Lockheed Martin Space building in Denver to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in order to be integrated to the launch vehicle. [ 95 ] The lander was launched on 5 May 2018 and arrived on Mars at approximately 19:54 UTC on 26 November 2018. The launch of the Atlas V rocket carrying InSight and MarCO from Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 3-E The spacecraft was launched on 5 May 2018 at 11:05 UTC on an Atlas V 401 launch vehicle (AV-078) from Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 3-East . [ 15 ] This was the first American interplanetary mission to launch from California. [ 96 ] The launch was managed by NASA's Launch Services Program . InSight was originally scheduled for launch on 4 March 2016 on an Atlas V 401 (4 meter fairing/zero (0) solid rocket boosters /single (1) engine Centaur ) from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, U.S., [ 96 ] but was called off in December 2015 due to a vacuum leak on the SEIS instrument. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] [ 99 ] The rescheduled launch window ran from 5 May to 8 June 2018. Major components of the launch vehicle include: Common Core Booster This launch did not use additional solid rocket boosters Centaur with Relay CubeSats InSight in a Payload fairing The journey to Mars took 6.5 months across 484 million km (301 million mi) for a touchdown on 26 November. [ 15 ] [ 19 ] After a successful landing, a three-month-long deployment phase commenced as part of its two-year (a little more than one Martian year ) prime mission. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Service tower rolls back. Pre-launch InSight heading to space InSight on way to Mars Exterior (artist concept) Interior Cruise [ edit ] An animation of InSight 's trajectory from 5 May 2018 to 26 November 2018: InSight · Earth · Mars After its launch from Earth on 5 May in 2018, it coasted through interplanetary space for 6.5 months traveling across 484 million km (301 million mi) for a touchdown on 26 November in that year. [ 15 ] [ 19 ] InSight cruise stage departed Earth at a speed of 10,000 kilometres per hour (6,200 mph). [ 1 ] The MarCo probes were ejected from the 2nd stage Centaur booster and traveled to Mars independent of the InSight cruise stage, but they were all launched together. [ citation needed ] During the cruise to Mars, the InSight cruise stage made several course adjustments, and the first of these (TCM-1) took place on 22 May 2018. [ 1 ] The cruise stage that carries the lander includes solar panels, antenna, star trackers, Sun sensor , inertial measurement unit among its technologies. [ 1 ] The thrusters are actually on the InSight lander itself, but there are cutouts in the shell so the relevant rockets can vent into space. [ 2 ] The final course correction was 25 November 2018, the day before its touch down. [ 102 ] A few hours before making contact with the Martian atmosphere, the cruise stage was jettisoned, on 26 November 2018. [ 102 ] Entry, descent, and landing [ edit ] On 26 November 2018, at approximately 19:53 UTC, mission controllers received a signal via the Mars Cube One (MarCO) satellites that the spacecraft had successfully touched down [ 16 ] at Elysium Planitia . [ 15 ] [ 17 ] [ 19 ] After landing, the mission took three months to deploy and commission the geophysical science instruments. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] It  then began its mission of observing Mars, which was planned to last for two years. [ 1 ] The spacecraft's mass that entered the atmosphere of Mars was 1,340 lb (608 kg). [ 103 ] There were  three major stages to InSight's landing: [ 103 ] Entry: after separating from the cruise stage the aeroshell enters the atmosphere and is subject to air and dust in the Martian atmosphere. Parachute descent: at a certain speed and altitude a parachute is deployed to slow the lander further. Rocket descent: closer to the ground the parachute is ejected and the lander uses rocket engines to slow the lander before touchdown. Landing sequence: [ 102 ] 25 November 2018, final course correction before EDL. 26 November 2018, Cruise stage jettisoned before entering the atmosphere. Several minutes later, the aeroshell containing the lander makes contact with the upper Martian atmosphere at 12,300 mph (19,800 km/h). At this point it is 80 miles (130 km) above Mars and in the next few minutes it lands, but undergoes many stages. [ 103 ] Aeroshell is heated to 1,500 °C (2,730 °F) during descent. At 385 m/s (1,260 ft/s) and ~11,100 m (36,400 ft) above the surface, the parachute is deployed. Several seconds later, the heat shield is jettisoned from the lander. The landing legs extended. Landing radar activated. Backshell jettisoned at a speed of about 60 m/s (200 ft/s) and at 1,100 m (3,600 ft) altitude. Landing rockets turned on. Roughly 50 m (160 ft) from the ground constant velocity mode is entered. Approaches ground at about 5 mph (8.0 km/h). Touchdown—each of the three lander legs have a sensor to detect ground contact. Descent rockets are turned off at touchdown. Begin surface operations. The lander's mass is about 358 kg (789 lb) [ 2 ] but on Mars, which has 0.376 of Earth's [ 65 ] gravity, it only weighs the equivalent of a 135 kg (298 lb) object on Earth.

[ 16 ] A few hours after landing, NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter relayed signals indicating that InSight 's solar panels had successfully unfurled and are generating enough electrical power to recharge its batteries daily. Odyssey also relayed a pair of images showing InSight 's landing site. [ 104 ] More images were acquired in stereo pairs to create 3D images, allowing InSight to find the best locations on the surface to place the heat probe and seismometer. Over the next few weeks, InSight checked health indicators and monitor both weather and temperature conditions at the landing site.

InSight on Mars − clear view (open lens cover) of landing area ( ICC ; 30 November 2018) InSight parachute, lander, shield (11 December 2018) InSight parachute, lander, shield (26 November 2018) As InSight 's science goals are not related to any particular surface feature of Mars, potential landing sites were chosen on the basis of practicality. Candidate sites needed to be near the equator of Mars to provide sufficient sunlight for the solar panels year round, have a low elevation to allow for sufficient atmospheric braking during EDL , be flat and relatively rock-free to reduce the probability of complications during landing, and have soft enough terrain to allow the heat flow probe to penetrate well into the ground. [ citation needed ] An optimal area that meets all these requirements is Elysium Planitia , so all 22 initial potential landing sites were located in this area. [ 105 ] The only two other areas on the equator and at low elevation, Isidis Planitia and Valles Marineris , are too rocky. In addition, Valles Marineris has too steep a gradient to allow safe landing. [ 7 ] In September 2013, the initial 22 potential landing sites were narrowed down to four, and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was then used to gain more information on each of the four potential sites before a final decision was made. [ 7 ] [ 106 ] Each site consists of a landing ellipse that measures about 130 by 27 km (81 by 17 mi). [ 107 ] In March 2017, scientists from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced that the landing site had been selected. It is located in western Elysium Planitia at 4°30′N 135°54′E ﻿ / ﻿ 4.5°N 135.9°E ﻿ / 4.5; 135.9 ﻿ ( InSight landing site ) . [ 108 ] The landing site is about 600 km (370 mi) north from where the Curiosity rover is operating in Gale Crater . [ 109 ] On 26 November 2018, the spacecraft successfully touched down at its landing site, [ 16 ] and in early December 2018 InSight lander and EDL components were imaged from space on the surface of Mars. [ 110 ] The images provided precise position of the lander: 4°30′09″N 135°37′24″E ﻿ / ﻿ 4.5024°N 135.6234°E ﻿ / 4.5024; 135.6234 . [ 9 ] Mars InSight Lander – Self-portraits First (11 December 2018) Second (11 April 2019) Third (24 April 2022) Before/After 1223 days of dust Surface operations [ edit ] On 26 November 2018, NASA reported that the InSight lander had landed successfully on Mars. The meteorological suite ( TWINS ) and magnetometer were operational, and the mission took approximately three months to deploy and commission the geophysical science instruments. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] After landing, the dust was allowed to settle for a few hours, during which time the solar array motors were warmed up and then the solar panels were unfurled. [ 111 ] [ 70 ] [ 100 ] The lander then reported its systems' status, acquired some images, and it powered down to sleep mode for its first night on Mars. On its first sol on Mars it set a new solar power record of 4.6 kilowatt-hours generated for a single Martian day (known as a "sol" ). [ 70 ] This amount is enough to support operations and deploy the sensors.

The wind and thermal shield deployed over seismometer (Sol 110) The lander (green) and shield (white dot) – viewed from space (4 February 2019) On 7 December 2018, InSight recorded the sounds of Martian winds with SEIS, which is able to record vibrations within human hearing range, although rather low (aka subwoofer-type sounds), and these were sent back to Earth. [ 114 ] This was the first time the sound of Mars wind was heard [ 114 ] after two previous attempts. [ 115 ] On 19 December 2018, the SEIS instrument was deployed onto the surface of Mars next to the lander by its robotic arm, [ 113 ] and it was commissioned on 4 February 2019. [ 116 ] After the seismometer became fully operational, the heat probe instrument was deployed on 12 February 2019. [ 117 ] [ 118 ] In April 2019, NASA reported that the Mars InSight lander detected its first marsquake . [ 119 ] [ 120 ] Mars – InSight Lander – Seismic Event ( AudioVideoFile ; Sol 128; 6 April 2019) In September 2019, researchers reported that InSight uncovered unexplained magnetic pulses , and magnetic oscillations . [ 121 ] On 24 February 2020, a summary of studies over the past year from InSight was presented which indicated that the planet Mars has active quakes, dust devils and magnetic pulses. [ 122 ] [ 123 ] InSight 's robotic arm cleans dust from the solar panel. (video; 0:08; 22 May 2021) In February 2020, according to new data gathered from NASA's InSight lander, it was found that the Martian magnetic field at the landing site is about 10 times stronger than previously thought, and fluctuates rapidly. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] In early 2021, the InSight team announced they would attempt to detect the arrival of the Mars 2020 mission using InSight's seismometers. Pre-landing modeling of the signals from Mars 2020's entry, descent and landing sequence suggested that the most probable source of any potential signal would be the impact of the spacecraft's cruise mass balance devices with the Martian surface, at speeds of around 4000 m/s. [ 126 ] [ 127 ] Shortly after successfully landing the Perseverance Rover , NASA announced that its landing went undetected by InSight. This helped demonstrate that Mars has a seismic efficiency of less than 3%. [ 128 ] On 12 April 2021, it was reported that Insight went into emergency hibernation because its solar panels were filled with Martian dust . [ 129 ] On 14 April, the lander began to transmit images after waking from hibernation. [ 130 ] On 3 May 2021, InSight used its robotic arm to trickle sand beside a solar panel. The InSight team wanted to let the sand blow away and touch the solar panels, sticking some dust particles to it, before leaving the solar panel. The sand trickle resulted in a boost in power of 30 watt-hours per sol. [ 131 ] In July 2021 three papers studying Mars's interior structure were published. Seismometer data confirms that the center of Mars is molten. The crust of Mars is thinner than expected and may have two or three sub-layers. [ 132 ] In January 2022, InSight went into safe mode due to a regional dust storm in the area, which caused a reduction in sunlight. During its time in safe mode, all but essential functions were suspended. It left safe mode on 19 January 2022 and resumed normal operations, however all science instruments were left off in the meantime. [ 133 ] As of May 2022, Insight has recorded 1,313 marsquakes. [ 53 ] The seismometer (SEIS), radio experiment (RISE) and the weather instruments (TWINS) continue to operate as the lander's Mars surface mission was extended by two years, until end of December 2022. [ 134 ] The reason the mission was retired was due to insufficient power generation on the solar panels, due to dust accumulation. [ 27 ] In August 2024, a reservoir of liquid water was discovered on Mars – deep in the rocky outer crust of the planet. The findings came from a new analysis of seismometer data, which recorded four years' of vibrations – Mars quakes – from deep inside the Red Planet. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package [ edit ] On 28 February 2019, the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package probe ( mole ) started digging into the surface of Mars. The probe and its digging mole were intended to reach a maximum depth of 5 m (16 ft) but it only went about 0.35 m (1.1 ft), or three-quarters of the way out of its housing structure. After many attempts, the effort was given up as a failure in January 2021.

(17 October 2019) Mole partially backs out of the hole it made. (26 October 2019) Mole tests (3 November 2019) Insight lander using its scoop to push on the back cap of the HP 3 mole In October 2019, the researchers at JPL concluded that the soil on Mars does not provide necessary friction for drilling, causing the mole to bounce around and form a wide pit around itself rather than dig deeper. They attempted a maneuver called pinning in which they pressed the side of the scoop against the mole location to pin the side of the wall of the hole and increase friction. [ 135 ] Pinning was initially successful, [ 136 ] but then the mole backed out of its hole after a few weeks, suggesting the soil is accumulating below the mole. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] In February 2020, the team reevaluated the risks of pushing the scoop directly against the back cap of the mole, and determined the procedure to be acceptable. [ 139 ] In June 2020, the team reported that the mole was finally underground, and was being evaluated to determine if the mole was able to dig as designed. [ 140 ] On 9 July 2020, it was revealed that images taken on 20 June 2020 showed the mole bouncing again, indicating that it did not have sufficient friction to dig deeper. One suggested solution was to partially fill the hole with soil to increase friction. [ 141 ] Mars InSight Lander - "Mole" - Final Efforts (9 January 2021) By August 2020, the operations team had made some progress using the scoop to assist the mole in digging deeper into its hole, by pressing against the back. The scoop was used to fill the hole of the partially submerged mole, burying it fully for the first time. The team hoped the mole can now dig further into the surface on its own, possibly with the additional assistance of the scoop. [ 142 ] On 14 January 2021, the heat probe part of the mission was declared to be over, after the science team had determined that the soil properties at the landing location were incompatible with what the instrument had been designed for. The team attempted many different remedies over nearly two years to get the mole to burrow into the soil, but in the end, the attempts did not succeed. The friction between the soil and the probe was not enough for the mole to hammer itself down through the soil. Another set of attempts to get the probe deeper took place on 9 January 2021. After they proved unsuccessful, the decision was made to leave the probe as is and end attempts to dig deeper. The mole did, with all the assisting measures, burrow itself completely underground. The top of the mole is 2 to 3 centimetres below the Martian surface. To be able to produce the intended scientific measurements, the mole needed to have dug itself at least 3 metres deep. Thus the mole was unsuccessful at producing its intended scientific results. However the mole's operations did produce useful and interesting results about the soil at the InSight site; about conducting excavation, or drilling, on Mars; and about operating the lander's robotic arm through the mole-rescue efforts that used the arm in ways that were unplanned before the mission. [ 134 ] MarCO spacecraft [ edit ] Flight hardware of Mars Cube One (MarCO) (folded up) MarCO CubeSats relaying data during InSight 's landing (artist concept) Main article: Mars Cube One The Mars Cube One (MarCO) spacecraft are a pair of 6U CubeSats that piggybacked with the InSight mission to test CubeSat navigation and endurance in deep space, and to help relay real-time communications (with an eight-minute lightspeed delay) [ 101 ] during the probe's entry, descent and landing (EDL) phase. [ 143 ] [ 144 ] The two 6U CubeSats, named MarCO A and B, are identical. [ 145 ] They were launched along with InSight , but separated soon after reaching space, [ 146 ] and they flew as a pair for redundancy while flanking the lander. [ 64 ] They did not enter orbit, but flew past Mars during the EDL phase of the mission and relayed InSight 's telemetry in real time. [ 147 ] [ 148 ] The success of the MarCO spacecraft proved the viability of the cubesat platform for deep space missions and helped serve as a technical demonstration for potential future missions of a similar nature. On 5 February 2019, NASA reported that the CubeSats went silent, and are unlikely to be heard from again. [ 149 ] Mass: 13.5 kg (30 lb) each.

[ 14 ] The material, returned in September 2023, is expected to enable scientists to learn more about the formation and evolution of the Solar System , its initial stages of planet formation, and the source of organic compounds that led to the formation of life on Earth. [ 15 ] Following the completion of the primary OSIRIS-REx (Regolith Explorer) mission, the spacecraft is planned to conduct a flyby of asteroid 99942 Apophis , renamed as OSIRIS-APEX (Apophis Explorer). [ 16 ] OSIRIS-REx was launched on September 8, 2016, flew past Earth on 22 September 2017 and rendezvoused with Bennu on 3 December 2018. [ 17 ] It spent the next two years analyzing the surface to find a suitable site from which to extract a sample. On 20 October 2020, OSIRIS-REx touched down on Bennu and successfully collected a sample. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] OSIRIS-REx left Bennu on 10 May 2021 [ 22 ] [ 23 ] and returned its sample to Earth on 24 September 2023, [ 24 ] subsequently starting its extended mission to study 99942 Apophis , where it will arrive in April 2029. Bennu was chosen as the target of study because it is a " time capsule " from the birth of the Solar System . [ 25 ] Bennu has a very dark surface and is classified as a B-type asteroid , a sub-type of the carbonaceous C-type asteroids . Such asteroids are considered primitive, having undergone little geological change from their time of formation. In particular, Bennu was selected because of the availability of pristine carbonaceous material, a key element in organic molecules necessary for life as well as representative of matter from before the formation of Earth. Organic molecules, such as amino acids , have previously been found in meteorite and comet samples, indicating that some ingredients necessary for life can be naturally synthesized in outer space. [ 1 ] The cost of the OSIRIS-REx mission is approximately US$800 million, [ 26 ] not including the Atlas V launch vehicle, which is about US$183.5 million. [ 27 ] The OSIRIS-APEX extended mission costs an additional US$200 million. [ 16 ] It is the third planetary science mission selected in the New Frontiers program , after Juno and New Horizons . The principal investigator is Dante Lauretta [ 28 ] from the University of Arizona , having taken over in 2011 after the original PI Michael Julian Drake died four months after the mission won approval from NASA. OSIRIS-REx was the first United States spacecraft to return samples from an asteroid. Previous asteroid returns include the Japanese probes Hayabusa , which visited 25143 Itokawa in 2010, and Hayabusa2 , which visited 162173 Ryugu in June 2018. Mission [ edit ] Overall management, engineering, and navigation for the OSIRIS missions are provided by NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , while the University of Arizona 's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory provides principal science operations. Lockheed Martin Space Systems built the spacecraft and provides mission operations. [ 2 ] The science team includes members from the United States, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy. [ 29 ] After traveling for approximately two years, the spacecraft rendezvoused with asteroid 101955 Bennu in December 2018, [ 30 ] and began 505 days of surface mapping at a distance of approximately 5 km (3.1 mi). [ 1 ] Results of that mapping were used by the mission team to select the site from which to take a sample of at least 60 g (2.1 oz) of material of the asteroid's surface. [ 31 ] Then a close approach (without landing) was carried out to allow extension of a robotic arm to gather the sample. [ 32 ] Following the successful collection of material (121.6 grams (4.29 oz)), [ 11 ] the sample was returned to Earth in a 46 kg (101 lb) capsule similar to that which returned the samples of Comet 81P/Wild on the space probe Stardust . The return trip to Earth was shorter than the outbound trip. The capsule landed by parachute at the Utah Test and Training Range on 24 September 2023 and was transported to the Johnson Space Center for processing in a dedicated research facility. [ 1 ] Asteroid Bennu , imaged by the OSIRIS-REx probe, 3 December 2018 OSIRIS-REx mission overview video OSIRIS-REx launch Launch [ edit ] The launch was on 8 September 2016 at 23:05 UTC on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V 411 from Cape Canaveral , Space Launch Complex 41 . [ 3 ] The 411 rocket configuration consists of a RD-180 powered first stage with a single AJ-60A solid fuel booster, and a Centaur upper stage . [ 33 ] OSIRIS-REx separated from the launch vehicle 55 minutes after ignition. [ 2 ] The launch was declared "exactly perfect" by the mission's principal investigator , with no anomalies before or during launch. [ 34 ] Cruise phase [ edit ] OSIRIS-REx entered the cruise phase shortly after separation from the launch vehicle, following successful solar panel deployment, propulsion system initiation, and establishment of a communication link with Earth. [ 34 ] Its hyperbolic escape speed from Earth was about 5.41 km/s (3.36 mi/s). [ 35 ] On 28 December 2016, the spacecraft successfully performed its first deep space maneuver to change its velocity by 431 m/s (1,550 km/h) using 354 kg (780 lb) of fuel. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] An additional, smaller firing of its thrusters on 18 January 2017 further refined its course for an Earth gravity assist on 22 September 2017. [ 36 ] The cruise phase lasted until its encounter with Bennu in December 2018, [ 30 ] after which it entered its science and sample collection phase. [ 36 ] During its cruise phase, OSIRIS-REx was used to search for a class of near-Earth objects known as Earth-Trojan asteroids as it passed through Sun–Earth L 4 Lagrange point . Between 9 and 20 February 2017, the OSIRIS-REx team used the spacecraft's MapCam camera to search for the objects, taking about 135 survey images each day for processing by scientists at the University of Arizona. The search was beneficial even though no new trojans were found, [ 38 ] as it closely resembled the operation required as the spacecraft approached Bennu, searching for natural satellites and other potential hazards. [ 37 ] [ 39 ] On 12 February 2017, while 673 × 10 ^ 6 km (418 × 10 ^ 6 mi) from Jupiter , the PolyCam instrument aboard OSIRIS-REx successfully imaged the giant planet and three of its moons, Callisto , Io , and Ganymede . [ 40 ] OSIRIS-REx flew by Earth on 22 September 2017. [ 41 ] Arrival and survey [ edit ] On 3 December 2018, NASA confirmed that OSIRIS-REx had matched the speed and orbit of Bennu at a distance of about 19 km (12 mi), effectively reaching the asteroid. OSIRIS-REx performed closer passes of the Bennu surface, initially at about 6.5 km (4.0 mi) through December to further refine the shape and orbit of Bennu. Preliminary spectroscopic surveys of the asteroid's surface by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft detected the presence of hydrated minerals in the form of clay . While researchers suspect that Bennu was too small to host water, the hydroxyl groups may have come from water present in its parent body before Bennu split off. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] OSIRIS-REx entered orbit around Bennu on 31 December 2018 at about 1.75 km (1.09 mi) to start its extensive remote mapping and sensing campaign for the selection of a sample site. This is the closest distance that any spacecraft has orbited a celestial object, closer than the Rosetta 's orbit of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko at 7 km (4.3 mi). [ 17 ] [ 44 ] At this altitude, it took the spacecraft 62 hours to orbit Bennu. [ 45 ] At the end of its detailed survey, the spacecraft entered a closer orbit with a radius of 1 km (0.62 mi). [ 46 ] Animation of OSIRIS-REx Around the Sun Around 101955 Bennu Touchdown on Bennu Landing on Earth OSIRIS-REx · 101955 Bennu · Earth · Sun Sample acquisition [ edit ] Artist's concept of TAGSAM instrument in operation Procedure [ edit ] Rehearsals were performed before sampling, during which the solar arrays were raised into a Y-shaped configuration to minimize the chance of dust accumulation during contact and provide more ground clearance in case the spacecraft tipped over (up to 45°) during contact. [ 29 ] The descent was very slow, minimizing thruster firings prior to contact to reduce the likelihood of asteroid surface contamination by unreacted hydrazine propellant. On 20 October 2020, contact with the surface of Bennu was detected using accelerometers, and the impact force was dissipated by a spring in the TAGSAM arm. [ 47 ] Upon surface contact by the TAGSAM instrument, a burst of nitrogen gas was released to blow regolith particles smaller than 2 cm (0.8 in) into the sampler head at the end of the robotic arm. A five-second timer limited the collection time to mitigate the chance of a collision, and the probe then executed a back-away maneuver to depart safely. [ 29 ] The plan was then for OSIRIS-REx to perform a braking maneuver a few days later to halt the drift away from the asteroid in case it was necessary to return for another sampling attempt. It would then take images of the TAGSAM head to verify a sample had been acquired. If a sample was acquired, the spacecraft would rotate about the short axis of the sample arm to determine sample mass by measuring momentum of inertia and determine if it was in excess of the required 60 g (2.1 oz). Both the braking and rotation maneuvers were canceled when images of the sample container clearly showed a large excess of material was collected, some of which was able to escape through the container's seal because some material had jammed the mechanism open. The collected material was scheduled for immediate storage in the Sample-Return Capsule. [ 48 ] [ 29 ] On 28 October 2020, the sample collector head was secured in the return capsule. Following the separation of the head from the collector arm, the arm was retracted into its launch configuration, and the Sample-Return Capsule lid was closed and latched preparing to return to Earth. [ 49 ] [ 50 ] In addition to the bulk sampling mechanism, contact pads on the end of the sampling head made of tiny stainless steel loops ( Velcro ) [ 51 ] passively collected dust grains smaller than 1 mm . Operations [ edit ] The final four candidate sample sites The successful October 2020 sample collection, showing OSIRIS-REx touching down on the Nightingale sample site Sample collection as seen by the navigation camera (00:47; 20 October 2020) Images of the TAGSAM head showing that it is full of rocks and dust collected from Bennu and that it is leaking material into space OSIRIS-REx successfully stows its sample of asteroid Bennu in October 2020. The sample container closes. NASA selected the final four candidate sample sites in August 2019, named Nightingale, Kingfisher, Osprey, and Sandpiper. [ 52 ] On 12 December 2019, they announced that Nightingale had been selected as the primary sample site and Osprey was selected as the backup site. [ 53 ] Both were within craters, with Nightingale near Bennu's north pole while Osprey was near the equator. [ 54 ] NASA planned to perform the first sampling in late August 2020; [ 55 ] NASA's originally planned Touch-and-Go (TAG) sample collection was scheduled for 25 August 2020, but was rescheduled for 20 October 2020, at 22:13 UTC. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] On 15 April 2020, the first sample collection rehearsal was successfully performed at the Nightingale sample site. The exercise took OSIRIS-REx as close as 65 m (213 ft) from the surface before performing a back-away burn. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] A second rehearsal was successfully completed on 11 August 2020, bringing OSIRIS-REx down to 40 m (130 ft) from the surface. This was the final rehearsal before the sample collection scheduled for 20 October 2020, at 22:13 UTC. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] At 22:13 UTC, on October 20, 2020, OSIRIS-REx successfully touched down on Bennu at a distance of 200 million miles (320 million kilometers) from Earth. [ 62 ] [ 63 ] NASA confirmed via images taken during sampling that the sampler had made contact. The spacecraft touched down within 92 cm (36 in) of the target location. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] A sample of the asteroid which was estimated to weigh at least 2 ounces (57 grams) was collected by OSIRIS-REx following the touch down. [ 18 ] After imaging the TAGSAM head, NASA concluded that there were rocks wedged in the mylar flap meant to keep the sample inside, causing the sample to slowly escape into space. [ 66 ] In order to prevent further loss of the sample through the flaps, NASA canceled the previously planned spinning maneuver meant to determine the mass of the sample as well as a navigational braking maneuver, and decided to stow the sample on 27 October 2020 rather than 2 November 2020 as originally planned, which was completed successfully. The collector head was observed hovering over the Sample Return Capsule (SRC) after the TAGSAM arm moved it into the proper position for capture, and the collector head was later secured onto the capture ring in the SRC. [ 66 ] When the head was seated into the Sample-Return Capsule's capture ring on 28 October 2020, the spacecraft performed a "backout check", which commanded the TAGSAM arm to back out of the capsule. This maneuver is designed to tug on the collector head and ensure that the latches – which keep the collector head in place – are well secured. Following the test, the mission team received telemetry confirming that the head was properly secured in the Sample-Return Capsule. Thereafter, on 28 October 2020, two mechanical parts on the TAGSAM arm were disconnected – these are the tube that carried the nitrogen gas to the TAGSAM head during sample collection and the TAGSAM arm itself. Over the next several hours, the mission team commanded the spacecraft to cut the tube that stirred up the sample through the TAGSAM head during sample collection, and separate the collector head from the TAGSAM arm. Once the team confirmed these activities were done, it commanded the spacecraft on 28 October 2020, to close and seal the Sample-Return Capsule, the final step of the sample stowage process of Bennu's samples. [ 67 ] To seal the SRC, the spacecraft closed the lid and then secured two internal latches. On inspecting images, it was observed that a few particles had escaped from the collector head during the stowage procedure, but it was confirmed that no particles would hinder the stowage process, since the team was confident that a plentiful amount of material remained inside of the head, more than the 60 g (2.1 oz) needed, that is, 121.6 g (4.29 oz). [ 11 ] The sample of Bennu was safely stored and ready for its journey to Earth. With the collector head secure inside the SRC, pieces of the sample would no longer be lost. [ 68 ] Sample return [ edit ] Two members of the recovery team examine the return capsule after landing. Close-up photo of the return capsule upon landing Expected landing area of return capsule in Utah On 7 April 2021, OSIRIS-REx completed its final flyover of Bennu and began drifting away from the asteroid. [ 69 ] On 10 May 2021, the spacecraft departed the vicinity of Bennu and began its two-year journey to Earth with the asteroid sample. [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] On 24 September 2023, at 4:42 a.m. MDT , at a distance of 63,000 miles (101,000 kilometers) from Earth, it ejected the sample return capsule, which re-entered the atmosphere at 27,650 miles per hour (44,500 km/h). [ 73 ] Due to a mistake in wiring, the drogue parachute did not deploy as planned at 100,000 feet (30,400 meters). [ 74 ] However, the main parachute was released when the spacecraft reached about 9,000 feet (2,700 meters), and it survived deployment despite higher than anticipated speeds. [ 74 ] About 8:52 a.m. MDT the capsule landed at 11 mph (18 km/h) at the Utah Test and Training Range , one minute earlier than predicted. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] The main spacecraft maneuvered to a trajectory away from Earth for its extended mission to Apophis in 2029 called OSIRIS-APEX. [ 77 ] At 10:15 a.m. MDT, the capsule was taken from the landing site by helicopter. The sample will be analyzed at NASA's Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Directorate (ARES) and at Japan's Extraterrestrial Sample Curation Center . [ 76 ] [ 78 ] Asteroid sample material requests will be considered and distributed to organizations worldwide by ARES. [ 23 ] On 11 October 2023, the recovered capsule was opened to reveal a "first look" at the asteroid sample contents. [ 12 ] Further looks were reported on 13 December 2023 and revealed organic molecules and unknown materials that require study to determine their composition. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] Some damaged fasteners prevented immediate opening, but, after three months, on 13 January 2024, NASA reported fully opening the recovered container. [ 81 ] [ 82 ] In total, 121.6 g (4.29 oz) of asteroidal material was recovered from the sample container. [ 11 ] [ 83 ] The samples became available to the world’s scientists for research by request on 1 April 2024. [ 84 ] On 15 May 2024, an overview of preliminary analytical studies on the returned samples was reported. [ 85 ] In January 2025, NASA revealed that while the samples did not show evidence of life, their contents suggest that the conditions necessary for the emergence of life were likely widespread in the early solar system. [ 86 ] The amount of ammonia, a volatile substance, in the samples indicates that Bennu emerged from the colder, outer regions of space. [ 86 ] In January 2025, it was reported that a wide range of carbon- and nitrogen-rich organic compounds have been identified in samples returned from Bennu, including 14 of the 20 amino acids that make up proteins in terrestrial organisms, as well as all four nucleobases (adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine) that are the essential building blocks of DNA and RNA. The samples contain a nearly equal mix of left-handed (L) and right-handed (D) amino acids, raising questions about whether asteroids like Bennu helped shape Earth's biochemistry. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Extended mission OSIRIS-APEX [ edit ] On 25 April 2022, NASA confirmed that the mission would be extended. After dropping off its sample to Earth on 24 September 2023, the mission became OSIRIS-APEX ('APophis EXplorer'). [ 77 ] As the new name suggests, its next target will be the near-Earth asteroid (and potentially hazardous object ) 99942 Apophis . Apophis will make an extremely close pass to the Earth on 13 April 2029, although there is no chance for an impact during this or any subsequent flybys in the near future. Observations of Apophis will commence on 8 April 2029, and a few days later, on 21 April, OSIRIS-APEX is planned to rendezvous with the asteroid. [ 90 ] OSIRIS-APEX will orbit Apophis for around 18 months in a regime similar to that at Bennu. The spacecraft will perform a maneuver, similar to sample collection at Bennu, by using its thrusters to disturb Apophis's surface, in order to expose and spectrally study the subsurface and the material beneath it. [ 16 ] The mission, initially proposed to be shut down with the FY2026 budget, was saved after legislators included continued funding for the project in the bill. [ citation needed ] Animation of OSIRIS-APEX Around the Sun Around 99942 Apophis OSIRIS-APEX · 99942 Apophis · Earth · Sun Name [ edit ] OSIRIS-REx and OSIRIS-APEX are acronyms, and each letter or combination of letters relates to part of the respective projects: [ 91 ] O – Origins SI – Spectral Interpretation RI – Resource Identification S – Security REx – Regolith Explorer APEX – Apophis Explorer Each of these words was chosen to represent an aspect of this mission. [ 91 ] For example, the S, for security means the security of Earth from impact by hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs). [ 91 ] Specifically it refers to better understanding the Yarkovsky effect , which can alter the trajectories of orbiting bodies. [ 91 ] Regolith Explorer means that the mission will study the texture, morphology, geochemistry , and spectral properties of the regolith of asteroid Bennu while Apophis Explorer corresponds to the study of Apophis asteroid. [ 91 ] When its heritage concept was proposed in the Discovery Program in 2004, it was called only OSIRIS, with REx for "Regolith Explorer" used descriptively rather than as part of the name. [ 92 ] The mission name itself was a reference to the god Osiris . Dante Lauretta, deputy PI of the mission, was called "a mythology buff" by the mission PI Michael Drake: "he was doodling on a pad and trying to capture the principal themes of what we are trying to do with this mission—study life origins, identify resources, planetary security in the form of asteroid deflection—and he realized he got the name of Osiris out of that, an ancient god of Egypt who may have been one of the first pharaohs." [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Similar to how Osiris in mythology taught agriculture to humanity which brought civilization and life to Egypt, OSIRIS-REx aims to return samples from an asteroid that may contain organics that led to the origin of life on Earth. [ 95 ] Rex is the Latin word for king which is a reference to Osiris being a mythical king of Egypt. Asteroid Bennu is named after the mythological bird from ancient Egyptian mythology that was associated with the Sun and the creation of the cosmos, while the asteroid for the second mission is named after the ancient Egyptian god Apophis , who was associated with chaos and destruction. [ 96 ] Both asteroids Bennu and Apophis are named after figures in Egyptian mythology just like OSIRIS-REx. Science objectives [ edit ] Sample Return Capsule infographic The science objectives of the mission are: [ 97 ] Return and analyze a sample of pristine carbonaceous asteroid regolith in an amount sufficient to study the nature, history, and distribution of its constituent minerals and organic compounds Map the global properties, chemistry, and mineralogy of a primitive carbonaceous asteroid to characterize its geologic and dynamic history and provide context for the returned samples Document the texture, morphology, geochemistry , and spectral properties of the regolith at the sampling site in situ at scales down to millimeters Measure the Yarkovsky effect (a thermal force on the object) on a potentially hazardous asteroid and constrain the asteroid properties that contribute to this effect Characterize the integrated global properties of a primitive carbonaceous asteroid to allow for direct comparison with ground-based telescopic data of the entire asteroid population Telescopic observations have helped define the orbit of 101955 Bennu , a near-Earth object (NEO) with a mean diameter in the range of 480 to 511 m (1,575 to 1,677 ft). [ 98 ] It completes an orbit of the Sun every 436.604 days (1.2 years). This orbit takes it close to the Earth every six years. Although the orbit is reasonably well known, scientists continue to refine it. It is critical to know the orbit of Bennu because recent calculations produced a cumulative probability of 1 in 1410 (or 0.071%) of impact with Earth from 2169 to 2199. [ 99 ] One of the mission objectives is to refine understanding of non-gravitational effects (such as the Yarkovsky effect ) on this orbit, and the implications of those effects for Bennu's collision probability. Knowing Bennu's physical properties will be critical for future scientists to understand when developing an asteroid impact avoidance mission.

[ 101 ] The sample-return capsule reentered the Earth's atmosphere with a parachute assisted landing. The capsule with encased samples was retrieved from Earth's surface and is being studied, as was done with the Stardust mission. Instruments [ edit ] In addition to its telecommunication equipment, the spacecraft carries a suite of instruments to image and analyze the asteroid on many wavelengths, [ 102 ] and retrieve a physical sample to return to Earth. The Planetary Society coordinated a campaign to invite interested persons to have their names or artwork on the mission's spirit of exploration saved on a microchip carried in the spacecraft. [ 103 ] OCAMS [ edit ] Imaging camera suite The OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite (OCAMS) consists of the PolyCam, the MapCam, and the SamCam. [ 102 ] Together, they acquire information on asteroid Bennu by providing global mapping, sample site reconnaissance and characterization, high-resolution imaging, and records of the sample acquisition. [ 104 ] PolyCam, an 20 cm (7.9 in) telescope, acquired visible-light images with increasingly higher resolution on approach the asteroid and high-resolution surface images from orbit MapCam searches for satellites and outgassing plumes. It maps the asteroid in four blue, green, red and near infrared channels, and informs the model of Bennu's shape and provides high resolution imaging of the potential sample sites SamCam continuously documents the sample acquisitions OVIRS [ edit ] OVIRS The OSIRIS-REx Visible and IR Spectrometer (OVIRS) is a spectrometer which maps minerals and organic substances on the asteroid's surface. [ 102 ] It provides full-disc asteroid spectral data at 20 m resolution. It maps blue to near-infrared, 400–4300 nm , with a spectral resolution of 7.5–22 nm . [ 105 ] This data was used in concert with OTES spectra to guide sample-site selection. The spectral ranges and resolving powers are sufficient to provide surface maps of carbonates , silicates , sulfates , oxides , adsorbed water and a wide range of organic compounds . [ citation needed ] OTES [ edit ] OTES The OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer (OTES) provides thermal emission spectral maps and local spectral information of candidate sample sites in the thermal infrared channel covering 4–50 μm, again to map mineral and organic substances. [ 102 ] The wavelength range, spectral resolution, and radiometric performance are sufficient to resolve and identify silicates, carbonates, sulfates, phosphates, oxides, and hydroxide minerals. OTES is also used to measure the total thermal emission from Bennu in support of the requirement to measure emitted radiation globally. [ citation needed ] Based on the performance of Mini-TES in the dusty surface environment of Mars, OTES was designed to be resilient to extreme dust contamination on the optical elements. [ citation needed ] REXIS [ edit ] The Regolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS) provided an X-ray spectroscopy map of Bennu to map element abundances. [ 102 ] REXIS was a collaborative development by four groups within Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University , with the potential to involve more than 100 students throughout the process. REXIS was based on flight heritage hardware, thereby minimizing elements of technical risk, schedule risk, and cost risk. [ 106 ] REXIS is a coded aperture soft X-ray (0.3–7.5 keV) telescope that images X-ray fluorescence line emission produced by the absorption of solar X-rays and the solar wind by elements in the regolith of Bennu leading to local X-ray emissions. Images were formed with 21 arcminute resolution (4.3 m spatial resolution at a distance of 700 m). Imaging was achieved by correlating the detected X-ray image with a 64×64 element random mask (1.536 mm pixels). REXIS stored data for each X-ray event to maximize data storage usage and minimize the risk. The pixels were addressed in 64×64 bins and the 0.3–7.5 keV range was covered by five broad bands and 11 narrow line bands. A 24-second resolution time tag was interleaved with the event data to account for Bennu rotation. Images were reconstructed on the ground after downlink of the event list. Images were formed simultaneously in 16 energy bands centered on the dominant lines of abundant surface elements from O-K (0.5 keV) to Fe-Kß (7 keV) as well the representative continuum. During orbital phase 5B, a 21-day orbit 700 m from the surface of Bennu, a total of at least 133 events/asteroid pixel/energy band were expected under 2 keV; enough to obtain significant constraints on element abundances at scales larger than 10 m. [ citation needed ] On 11 November 2019, while observing the asteroid with REXIS, university students and researchers involved in the mission unexpectedly discovered an X-ray burst from a black hole named MAXI J0637-430 located 30,000 light-years away. [ 107 ] OLA [ edit ] The OSIRIS-REx Laser Altimeter (OLA) is a scanning and lidar instrument that will provide high resolution topographical information throughout the mission. [ 102 ] The information received by OLA creates global topographic maps of Bennu, local maps of candidate sample sites, ranging in support of other instruments, and support navigation and gravity analyses. [ citation needed ] OLA scans the surface of Bennu at specific intervals to rapidly map the entire surface of the asteroid to achieve its primary objective of producing local and global topographic maps. The data collected by OLA will also be used to develop a control network relative to the center of mass of the asteroid and to enhance and refine gravitational studies of Bennu. [ citation needed ] OLA has a single common receiver and two complementary transmitter assemblies that enhance the resolution of the information brought back. OLA's high-energy laser transmitter is used for ranging and mapping from 1 to 7.5 km (0.62 to 4.66 mi). The low-energy transmitter is used for ranging and imaging from 0.5 to 1 km (0.31 to 0.62 mi). The repetition rate of these transmitters sets the data acquisition rate of OLA. Laser pulses from both the low and high energy transmitters are directed onto a movable scanning mirror, which is co-aligned with the field of view of the receiver telescope limiting the effects of background solar radiation. Each pulse provides target range, azimuth, elevation, received intensity and a time-tag. [ citation needed ] OLA was funded by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and was built by MDA at Brampton , Ontario , Canada. [ 108 ] OLA was delivered for integration with the spacecraft on 17 November 2015. [ 109 ] The lead instrument scientist of OLA is Michael Daly from York University . [ 110 ] TAGSAM [ edit ] Main article: TAGSAM TAGSAM arm test before launch The sample-return system, called Touch-And-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism (TAGSAM), consists of a sampler head with an articulated 3.35 m (11.0 ft) arm. [ 2 ] [ 102 ] An on-board nitrogen source supports up to three separate sampling attempts to acquire at least 60 g (2.1 oz) of sample in all. The surface contact pads also collect fine-grained material. [ citation needed ] Highlights of the TAGSAM instrument and technique include: Relative approach velocity of 10 cm/s (3.9 in/s) [ 111 ] Contact within 25 m (82 ft) of selected location OCAMS documents sampling at 1 Hz Collect samples in less than five seconds, direct nitrogen (N 2 ) annular jet fluidizes regolith, surface-contact pad captures surface sample Verify bulk sample collection via spacecraft inertia change; surface sample by imaging sampler head Sampler head stored in sample-return capsule and returned to Earth Cooperation with JAXA [ edit ] Hayabusa2 is a similar mission from JAXA to collect samples from near-Earth asteroid 162173 Ryugu . It arrived at the asteroid in June 2018, left in November 2019 after two successful sample collections, and returned to Earth in December 2020. The recovery capsule of Hayabusa2 re-entered Earth atmosphere and landed in Australia, as planned, on 5 December 2020. The sample contents were to be extensively analyzed, including water content, to provide clues on the initial formation of the asteroid. The main module of Hayabusa2 is performing a swing-by procedure to "push" it onward to its next destination, asteroid 1998KY26, by 2031. Because the two missions were similar and had overlapping timelines (OSIRIS-REx was still in the return phase), NASA and JAXA signed an agreement to collaborate on sample exchange and research. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] The two teams visited each other, with representatives from JAXA visiting the OSIRIS-REx Science Operations Center at the University of Arizona , and members of the OSIRIS-REx team traveling to Japan to meet with the Hayabusa2 team. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] The teams are sharing software, data, and techniques for analysis, and will eventually exchange portions of the samples that are returned to Earth. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] OSIRIS-REx II [ edit ] OSIRIS-REx II was a 2012 mission concept to replicate the original spacecraft for a double mission, with the second vehicle collecting samples from the two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos . It was stated that this mission would be both the quickest and least expensive way to get samples from the moons. Mars I and II are now the aims of another mission, led by JAXA, called MMX , to be launched in 2026.

It used repeated gravity assists from Venus to develop an eccentric orbit, approaching within 9.86 solar radii (6.9 million km or 4.3 million miles) [ 7 ] [ 8 ] from the center of the Sun. At its closest approach in 2024, its speed relative to the Sun was 690,000 km/h (430,000 mph) or 191 km/s (118.7 mi/s), which is 0.064%  the speed of light . [ 7 ] [ 9 ] It is the fastest object ever built on Earth . [ 10 ] The project was announced in the fiscal 2009 budget year. Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory designed and built the spacecraft, [ 11 ] which was launched on 12 August 2018. [ 2 ] It became the first NASA spacecraft named after a living person, honoring physicist Eugene Newman Parker , professor emeritus at the University of Chicago . [ 12 ] On 29 October 2018, at about 18:04 UTC, the spacecraft became the closest ever artificial object to the Sun. The previous record, 42.73 million kilometers (26.55 million miles) from the Sun's surface, was set by the Helios 2 spacecraft in April 1976. [ 13 ] At its perihelion on 27 September 2023, the PSP's closest approach was 7.26 million kilometers (4.51 million miles), [ 14 ] reaching this distance again on 29 March 2024. [ 15 ] On 24 December 2024 at 11:53 UTC, PSP made its closest approach to the Sun, coming to a distance of 6.1 million km (3.8 million miles) from the surface. Its beacon signal was received on 26 December, showing that it had survived the passage through the corona. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Detailed telemetry was received 1 January 2025. [ 18 ] In 2025, the teams from NASA, Johns Hopkins, and partners were awarded the 2024 Collier Trophy for their achievements. [ 19 ] History [ edit ] The Parker Solar Probe concept originates in the 1958 report by the Fields and Particles Group, Committee 8 of the National Academy of Sciences ' Space Science Board, [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] which proposed several space missions including "a solar probe to pass inside the orbit of Mercury to study the particles and fields in the vicinity of the Sun". [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Studies in the 1970s and 1980s reaffirmed its importance, [ 23 ] but it was always postponed due to cost. A cost-reduced Solar Orbiter mission was studied in the 1990s, and a more capable Solar Probe mission served as one of the centerpieces of the Outer Planet/Solar Probe (OPSP) program formulated by NASA in the late 1990s. The first three missions of the program were planned to be: the Solar Orbiter , the Pluto and Kuiper belt reconnaissance Pluto Kuiper Express mission, and the Europa Orbiter astrobiology mission focused on Europa . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Evolution of PSP design The original Solar Probe design used a gravity assist from Jupiter to enter a polar orbit which dropped almost directly toward the Sun. While this explored the important solar poles and came even closer to the surface (3 R ☉ , a perihelion of 4 R ☉ ), [ 26 ] the extreme variation in solar irradiance made for an expensive mission and required a radioisotope thermal generator for power. The trip to Jupiter also made for a long mission, 3 + 1 ⁄ 2 years to first solar perihelion, 8 years to second. Following the appointment of Sean O'Keefe as Administrator of NASA, the entirety of the OPSP program was canceled as part of President George W. Bush 's request for the 2003 United States federal budget . [ 27 ] Administrator O'Keefe cited a need for a restructuring of NASA and its projects, falling in line with the Bush Administration's wish for NASA to refocus on "research and development, and addressing management shortcomings". [ 27 ] In the early 2010s, plans for the Solar Probe mission were incorporated into a lower-cost Solar Probe Plus . [ 28 ] The redesigned mission uses multiple Venus gravity assists for a more direct flight path, which can be powered by solar panels . It has a higher perihelion, reducing the demands on the thermal protection system. In May 2017, the spacecraft was renamed the Parker Solar Probe in honor of astrophysicist Eugene Newman Parker , [ 29 ] [ 30 ] who had proposed the existence of nanoflares as an explanation of coronal heating [ 31 ] as well as having developed a mathematical theory that predicted the existence of solar wind . [ 32 ] The solar probe cost NASA US$1.5 billion. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] The launch rocket bore a dedication in memory of APL engineer Andrew A. Dantzler who had worked on the project. [ 35 ] A memory card containing names submitted by over 1.1 million people was mounted on a plaque and installed below the spacecraft's high-gain antenna. [ 36 ] The card also contains photos of Parker and a copy of his 1958 scientific paper predicting important aspects of solar physics . [ 37 ] Spacecraft [ edit ] The Parker Solar Probe is the first spacecraft to fly into the low solar corona. It will assess the structure and dynamics of the Sun's coronal plasma and magnetic field, the energy flow that heats the solar corona and impels the solar wind, and the mechanisms that accelerate energetic particles. The spacecraft's systems are protected from the extreme heat and radiation near the Sun by a solar shield. Incident solar radiation at perihelion is approximately 650 kW/m 2 , or 475 times the intensity at Earth orbit . [ 1 ] [ 38 ] : 31 The solar shield is hexagonal, mounted on the Sun-facing side of the spacecraft, 2.3 m (7 ft 7 in) in diameter, [ 39 ] 11.4 cm (4.5 in) thick, and is made of two panels of reinforced carbon–carbon composite with a lightweight 11-centimeter-thick (4.5 in) carbon foam core, [ 40 ] which is designed to withstand temperatures outside the spacecraft of about 1,370 °C (2,500 °F). [ 1 ] The shield weighs only 73 kilograms (160 lb) and keeps the spacecraft's instruments at 29 °C (85 °F). [ 40 ] A white reflective alumina surface layer minimizes absorption. The spacecraft systems and scientific instruments are located in the central portion of the shield's shadow, where direct radiation from the Sun is fully blocked. If the shield was not between the spacecraft and the Sun, the probe would be damaged and become inoperative within tens of seconds. As radio communication with Earth takes about eight minutes in each direction, the Parker Solar Probe has to act autonomously and rapidly to protect itself. This is done using four light sensors to detect the first traces of direct sunlight coming from the shield limits and engaging movements from reaction wheels to reposition the spacecraft within the shadow again. According to project scientist Nicky Fox, the team described it as "the most autonomous spacecraft that has ever flown". [ 6 ] The primary power for the mission is a dual system of solar panels ( photovoltaic arrays ). A primary photovoltaic array, used for the portion of the mission outside 0.25 au , is retracted behind the shadow shield during the close approach to the Sun, and a much smaller secondary array powers the spacecraft through closest approach. This secondary array uses pumped-fluid cooling to maintain operating temperature of the solar panels and instrumentation. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] A light bar testing in the Astrotech processing facility.

Trajectory [ edit ] An animation of the Parker Solar Probe 's trajectory from August 7, 2018, to August 29, 2025: Parker Solar Probe · Sun · Mercury · Venus · Earth For more detailed animation, see this video. The Parker Solar Probe mission design used repeated gravity assists at Venus to incrementally decrease its orbital perihelion to achieve a final altitude (above the surface) of approximately 8.5 solar radii, or about 6 × 10 ^ 6 km (3.7 × 10 ^ 6 mi; 0.040 au). [ 39 ] The spacecraft trajectory included seven Venus flybys over nearly seven years to gradually shrink its elliptical orbit around the Sun, for a total of 24 orbits. [ 1 ] The near Sun radiation environment was predicted to cause spacecraft charging effects, radiation damage in materials and electronics, and communication interruptions, so the orbit is highly elliptical with short times spent near the Sun. [ 38 ] The trajectory required high launch energy, so the probe was launched on a Delta IV Heavy launch vehicle and an upper stage based on the Star 48BV solid rocket motor. [ 38 ] Interplanetary gravity assists provided further deceleration relative to its heliocentric orbit , which resulted in a heliocentric speed record at perihelion . [ 4 ] [ 43 ] As the probe passed around the Sun in December 2024, it achieved a velocity of 690,000 km/h (430,000 mph) or 191 km/s (118.7 mi/s) in the heliocentric ecliptic reference frame , which temporarily made it the fastest human-made object, almost three times as fast as the previous record holder, Helios-2 . [ 7 ] [ 9 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Launch injection was very close to predictions, but nevertheless required path correction. Trajectory was re-optimized after the launch to save fuel. The first Venus flyby was only 52 days after the launch; three trajectory correction maneuvers were performed in this window. [ 22 ] As described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion , which apply to any object in an orbit, gravity will cause the spacecraft to accelerate as it nears perihelion, then slow down again afterward until it reaches its aphelion . Because of its highly elliptical orbit and the Sun's strong gravity, this effect is particularly pronounced for the Parker Solar Probe.  During a perihelion on September 27, 2023, the spacecraft traveled at 394,736 miles per hour (176.5 km/s), fast enough to fly from New York to Tokyo in just over a minute. [ 14 ] Final orbit, possible extensions and end of mission [ edit ] An apparent size of the Sun as seen from the Parker Solar Probe at perihelion compared to its apparent size seen from Earth A visualization of PSP's projected orbit through 2029, assuming it continues to follow its current trajectory. The PSP performed its final gravity assist on November 6, 2024. It set the spacecraft on a new orbit passing 6.1 million kilometers (3.8 million miles) from the surface of the Sun. [ 47 ] A beacon transmission was made and received successfully on December 20 to confirm that the craft was operating normally ahead of the perihelion. The exact time of closest approach was 11:53 UTC on December 24 but the craft was out of contact at this time. A further beacon transmission confirming successful passage was received on December 26. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] This final orbit is inside the orbit of Venus and so no further encounters with that planet are planned. PSP will continue in this orbit but requiring adjustment to maintain attitude so that its transmitters point at Earth. Eventually its thrusters will run out of fuel and full functioning will not then be possible. The plan is to then rotate the craft so that its instruments will be exposed to the full radiance of the Sun for the first time. This is expected to ablate and destroy them. The heat shield will remain and is expected to continue to orbit the Sun for millions of years. [ 50 ] PSP's mission can be extended beyond main mission that will end in 2025. Currently discussed plan is "to complete the solar cycle at the 9.86 Rs perihelion distance". [ 51 ] Instruments [ edit ] Schematic view of all PSP's instruments Parker Solar Probe 3D model Parker Solar Probe has four main instruments: [ 52 ] [ 53 ] FIELDS (Electromagnetic Fields Investigation). The instrument suite captures the scale and shape of electric and magnetic fields in the Sun's atmosphere. FIELDS measures waves and turbulence in the inner heliosphere with high time resolution to understand the fields associated with waves, shocks and magnetic reconnection, a process by which magnetic field lines explosively realign. FIELDS measures the electric field around the spacecraft with five antennas, four of which stick out beyond the spacecraft's heat shield and into the sunlight, where they experience temperatures of 1,370 °C (2,500 °F). The 2-meter-long (6 ft 7 in) antennas are made of a niobium alloy, which can withstand extreme temperatures. FIELDS measures electric fields across a broad frequency range both directly and remotely. Operating in two modes, the four sunlit antennas measure the properties of the fast and slow solar wind — the flow of solar particles constantly streaming out from the Sun. The fifth antenna, which sticks out perpendicular to the others in the shade of the heat shield, helps make a three-dimensional picture of the electric field at higher frequencies. The suite also has three magnetometers to assess the magnetic field. A search coil magnetometer, or SCM, measures how the magnetic field changes over time. Two identical fluxgate magnetometers, MAGi and MAGo, measure the large-scale coronal magnetic field. The fluxgate magnetometers are specialized for measuring the magnetic field further from the Sun where it varies at a slower rate, while the search coil magnetometer is necessary closer to the Sun where the field changes quickly, as it can sample the magnetic field at a rate of two million times per second. The Principal Investigator is Stuart Bale at the University of California, Berkeley . [ 52 ] IS☉IS (Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun). The instrument uses two complementary instruments to measure particles across a wide range of energies. By measuring electrons, protons and ions, IS☉IS will understand the particles' lifecycles — where they came from, how they became accelerated and how they move out from the Sun through interplanetary space. The two energetic particle instruments on IS☉IS are called EPI-Lo and EPI-Hi (EPI stands for Energetic Particle Instrument). EPI-Lo measures the spectra of electrons and ions and identifies carbon, oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon, iron and two isotopes of helium, He-3 and He-4. Distinguishing between helium isotopes will help determine which of several theorized mechanisms caused the particles' acceleration. The instrument has a design with an octagonal dome body supporting 80 viewfinders. Multiple viewfinders provide a wide field of view to observe low-energy particles. An ion that enters EPI-Lo through one of the viewfinders first passes through two carbon-polyimide-aluminum foils and then encounters a solid-state detector. Upon impact, the foils produce electrons, which are measured by a microchannel plate. Using the amount of energy left by the ion's impact on the detector and the time it takes the ions to pass through the sensor identifies the species of the particles. EPI-Hi uses three particle sensors composed of stacked layers of detectors to measure particles with energies higher than those measured by EPI-Lo. The front few layers are composed of ultra-thin silicon detectors made up of geometric segments, which allows for the determination of the particle's direction and helps reduce background noise. Charged particles are identified by measuring how deep they travel into the stack of detectors and how many electrons they pull off atoms in each detector, a process called ionization. At closest approach to the Sun, EPI-Hi will be able to detect up to 100,000 particles per second. The Principal Investigator is David McComas at Princeton University . [ 52 ] [ 54 ] WISPR (Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe). These optical telescopes acquire images of the corona and inner heliosphere . WISPR uses two cameras with radiation-hardened Active Pixel Sensor CMOS detectors. The camera's lenses are made of a radiation hard BK7, a common type of glass used for space telescopes, which is also sufficiently hardened against the impacts of dust. The Principal Investigator is Russell Howard at the Naval Research Laboratory . [ 52 ] SWEAP (Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons). This investigation will count the electrons, protons and helium ions, and measure their properties such as velocity, density, and temperature. Its main instruments are the Solar Probe Analyzers (SPAN, two electrostatic analyzers ) and the Solar Probe Cup (SPC). SPC is a Faraday cup , a metal device that can catch charged particles in a vacuum. Peeking over the heat shield to measure how electrons and ions are moving, the cup is exposed to the full light, heat and energy of the Sun. The cup is composed of a series of highly transparent grids — one of which uses variable high voltages to sort the particles — above several collector plates, which measure the particles' properties. The variable voltage grid also helps sort out background noise, such as cosmic rays and photoionized electrons, which could otherwise bias the measurements. The grids, located near the front of the instrument, can reach temperatures of 1,650 °C (3,000 °F), glowing red while the instrument makes measurements. The instrument uses pieces of sapphire to electrically isolate different components within the cup. As it passes close to the Sun, SPC takes up to 146 measurements per second to accurately determine the velocity, density and temperature of the Sun's plasma. SPAN is composed of two instruments, SPAN-A and SPAN-B, which have wide fields of view to allow them to see the parts of space not observed by SPC. Particles encountering the detectors enter a maze that sends the particles through a series of deflectors and voltages to sort the particles based on their mass and charge. While SPAN-A has two components to measure both electrons and ions, SPAN-B looks only at electrons. The Principal Investigator is Justin Kasper at the University of Michigan and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory . [ 52 ] An additional theoretical investigation named Heliospheric origins with Solar Probe Plus (HeliOSPP) starting from 2010 and ending in 2024 has the role of providing theoretical input and independent assessment of scientific performance to the Science Working Group (SWG) and the SPP Project to maximize the scientific return from the mission. The Principal Investigator is Marco Velli at the University of California, Los Angeles and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ; he also serves as the Observatory Scientist for the mission. [ 38 ] Mission [ edit ] Launch of the Parker Solar Probe in 2018 Artist's rendition of the Parker Solar Probe approaching the Sun The Parker Solar Probe was launched on 12 August 2018, at 07:31 UTC. The spacecraft operated nominally after launching. During its first week in space it deployed its high-gain antenna, magnetometer boom, and electric field antennas. [ 55 ] The spacecraft performed its first scheduled trajectory correction on 20 August 2018, while it was 8.8 million kilometers (5.5 million mi) from Earth, and travelling at 63,569 kilometers per hour (39,500 mph) [ 56 ] Instrument activation and testing began in early September 2018. On 9 September 2018, the two WISPR telescopic cameras performed a successful first-light test, transmitting wide-angle images of the background sky towards the Galactic Center . [ 57 ] The probe successfully performed the first of the seven planned Venus flybys on 3 October 2018, where it came within about 2,400 kilometers (1,500 mi) of Venus in order to reduce the probe's speed and orbit closer to the Sun. [ 58 ] The second flyby of Venus on December 26, 2019. The velocity decreases by 2.9 km/s to 26 km/s (red circle), shifting the spacecraft to a new orbit closer to the Sun. Within each orbit of the Parker Solar Probe around the Sun, the portion within 0.25 AU is the Science Phase, in which the probe is actively and autonomously making observations. Communication with the probe is largely cut off in that phase. [ 59 ] : 4 Science phases run for a few days both before and after each perihelion. They lasted 11.6 days for the earliest perihelion, and will drop to 9.6 days for the final, closest perihelion. [ 59 ] : 8 Much of the rest of each orbit is devoted to transmitting data from the science phase. But during this part of each orbit, there are still periods when communication is not possible. First, the requirement that the heat shield of the probe be pointed towards the Sun sometimes puts the heat shield between the antenna and Earth. Second, even when the probe is not particularly near the Sun, when the angle between the probe and the Sun, as seen from Earth, is too small, the Sun's radiation can overwhelm the communication link. [ 59 ] : 11–14 After the first Venus flyby , the probe was in an elliptical orbit with a period of 150 days (two-thirds the period of Venus), making three orbits while Venus makes two. After the second flyby, the period shortened to 130 days. After less than two orbits, only 198 days later, it encountered Venus a third time at a point earlier in the orbit of Venus. This encounter shortened its period to half of that of Venus, or about 112.5 days. After two orbits it met Venus a fourth time at about the same place, shortening its period to about 102 days. [ 60 ] After 237 days, it met Venus for the fifth time and its period was shortened to about 96 days, three-sevenths that of Venus. It then made seven orbits while Venus made three. The sixth encounter, almost two years after the fifth, shortened its period down to 92 days, two-fifths that of Venus. After five more orbits (two orbits of Venus), it met Venus for the seventh and last time, decreasing its period to 88 or 89 days and allowing it to approach closer to the Sun.

For a variety of reasons, including the fact that the launch had to be delayed at the last minute, actual details could differ from the ones presented in the work. ^ Inbound indicates that the Venus flyby will take place after Parker ' s aphelion (in the case of the first flyby, after its launch), on its way to perihelion. Outbound indicates that the Venus flyby will take place after Parker ' s perihelion, on its way to aphelion. ^ Inside indicates that the probe will pass in between Venus and the Sun. Outside indicates that the probe will pass beyond Venus from the Sun; the probe will briefly pass through Venus's shadow in those instances. ^ The first orbital period of 174 days was the orbit established by the launch and course adjustments, and was the orbit the probe would have taken had nothing further happened to change it. That orbit was, per mission plan, never completed. On the probe's first inbound course towards the Sun, it made its first planned encounter with Venus, which shortened its orbit considerably. ^ The altitude is from the source cited, [ 59 ] : 6 dated 2014. 2548 km comes to 1583 mi. NASA's [ 62 ] and Johns Hopkins's [ 63 ] press releases (identical), say "...came within about 1500 miles of Venus' surface..." A NASA blog, [ 58 ] says, "...completed its flyby of Venus at a distance of about 1500 miles..." Other news reports, presumably taking that information, also provide a figure of 2414 km. But neither the NASA/Hopkins press release nor the blog gives a figure in kilometers. Both the NASA and Hopkins press releases say that the flyby reduced the speed of the Parker Solar Probe (relative to the Sun) by about 10%, or 7000 mph. This altered the orbit, bringing perihelion about 4 million miles closer to the Sun than it would have been without the gravity assist. ^ By way of comparison, the planet Mercury orbits the Sun at a distance varying from about 46,001,200 km at its closest to about 69,816,900 km at its farthest. ^ After the second solar encounter phase, Parker Solar Probe was able to download much more data than NASA had expected. So NASA announced a substantial extension of the third solar encounter phase from 11 days to about 35 days. The observational instruments were turned on when Parker Solar Probe came within 0.45 au on the inbound trip, and are planned to run until the probe reaches about 0.50 au outbound. [ 67 ] ^ The third flyby of Venus was the first to pass behind Venus from the point of view of the Sun. The probe was in Venus's shadow, obscured from the Sun, for about 11 minutes, and passed through a so-called "tail" of Venus – a trail of charged particles from the atmosphere of Venus. The probe's instruments were to be turned on to make observations. [ 73 ] Findings [ edit ] PSP observed switchbacks — traveling disturbances in the solar wind that caused the magnetic field to bend back on itself. NASA animation of the Probe passing through the Sun's stellar corona . Inside the boundary at the corona's edge, its Alfvén critical surface , plasma connects to the Sun by waves traveling back and forth to the surface. On November 6, 2018, Parker Solar Probe observed its first magnetic switchbacks – sudden reversals in the direction of the magnetic field carried by the solar wind. [ 74 ] They were first observed by the NASA-ESA  mission Ulysses , the first spacecraft to fly over the Sun's poles. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] The switchbacks generate heat that warms solar corona. [ 77 ] On 4 December 2019, the first four research papers were published describing findings during the spacecraft's first two dives near the Sun. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] They reported the direction and strength of the Sun's magnetic field, and described the unusually frequent and short-lived changes in the direction of the Sun's magnetic field. These measurements confirm the hypothesis that Alfvén waves are the leading candidates for understanding the mechanisms that underlie the coronal heating problem . [ 79 ] [ 83 ] The probe observed approximately a thousand "rogue" magnetic waves in the solar atmosphere that instantly increase solar wind speeds by as much as 300,000 miles per hour (480,000 km/h) and in some cases completely reverse the local magnetic field. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] They also reported that, using the "beam of electrons that stream along the magnetic field", they were able to observe that "the reversals in the Sun's magnetic field are often associated with localized enhancements in the radial component of the plasma velocity (the velocity in the direction away from the Sun's center)". The researchers found a "surprisingly large azimuthal component of the plasma velocity (the velocity perpendicular to the radial direction). This component results from the force with which the Sun's rotation slingshots plasma out of the corona when the plasma is released from the coronal magnetic field". [ 79 ] [ 80 ] PSP discovered evidence of a cosmic dust -free zone of 3.5 million miles (5.6 million kilometers) radius from the Sun, due to vaporisation of cosmic dust particles by the Sun's radiation. [ 86 ] On April 28, 2021, during its eighth flyby of the Sun, Parker Solar Probe encountered the specific magnetic and particle conditions at 18.8 solar radii that indicated that it penetrated the Alfvén surface ; [ 87 ] [ 88 ] the probe measured the solar wind plasma environment with its FIELDS and SWEAP instruments. [ 89 ] This event was described by NASA as "touching the Sun". [ 87 ] On 25 September 2022, the first discovery of a comet was made in images from the Parker Solar Probe. The comet is named PSP-001. It was found by Peter Berrett, who participates in the NASA funded Sungrazer project. [ 90 ] PSP-001 was discovered in images from 29 May 2022, part of the spacecraft's 12th approach to the Sun. Since this discovery, a further 19 sungrazing comets have been discovered in the images taken by the Parker Solar Probe, including three non-group comets.

It is the first spacecraft that detected this long theorized event. [ 93 ] Collaborations [ edit ] The PSP and ESA-NASA Solar Orbiter (SolO) missions cooperated to trace solar wind and transients from their sources on the Sun to the inner interplanetary space. [ 94 ] In 2022, PSP and SolO planners collaborated to study why the Sun's atmosphere is "150 times hotter" than its surface. SolO observed the Sun from 140 million kilometers, while PSP simultaneously observed the Sun's corona during flyby at a distance of nearly 9 million kilometers. [ 95 ] [ 96 ] In March 2024, both space probes were at their closest approaches to the Sun, PSP at 7.3 million km, and SolO at 45 million km. SolO observed the Sun, while PSP sampled the plasma of the solar wind, allowing scientists to compare data from both probes. [ 97 ] Coordinated observations were also done with SOHO and STEREO-A spacecraft. [ 98 ] Gallery [ edit ] WISPR first light image. The right portion of the image is from WISPR's inner telescope, which is a 40-degree field of view and begins 58.5 degrees from the Sun's center. The left portion is from the outer telescope, which is a 58-degree field of view and ends about 160 degrees from the Sun. [ 99 ] The view from the probe's WISPR instrument on Sept. 25, 2018, shows Earth, the bright sphere near the middle of the right-hand panel. The elongated mark toward the bottom of the panel is a lens reflection from the WISPR instrument [ 100 ] Photo from the WISPR shows a coronal streamer, seen over the east limb of the Sun on Nov. 8, 2018, at 1:12 a.m. EST. The fine structure of the streamer is very clear, with at least two rays visible. Parker Solar Probe was about 16.9 million miles (21.2 million km) from the Sun's surface when this image was taken. The bright object near the center of the image is Mercury, and the dark spots are a result of background correction. [ 101 ] When Parker Solar Probe was making its closest approach to the Sun on June 7, 2020, WISPR captured the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn in its field of view [ 102 ] Photo taken by the probe during its second Venus flyby, July 2020 As Parker Solar Probe flew by Venus on its fourth flyby, its WISPR instrument captured these images, showing the nightside surface of the planet [ 103 ] [ 104 ] As the probe passed through the Sun's corona in early 2021, it flew by structures called coronal streamers (timelapse encompassing 4 days) This video by WISPR during its record-breaking flyby of the Sun on Dec. 25, 2024, shows the solar wind racing out from the Sun's outer atmosphere, the corona.

The exact value was not finalized until the seventh Venus gravity assist in 2024. Mission planners might decide to alter it slightly before then.

[ 4 ] The mission comprises two satellites launched together: the Mercury Planetary Orbiter ( MPO ) and Mio ( Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter , MMO ). [ 5 ] The mission will perform a comprehensive study of Mercury, including characterization of its magnetic field , magnetosphere , and both interior and surface structure. It was launched on an Ariane 5 [ 2 ] rocket on 20 October 2018, with Mercury orbit insertion planned for November 2026, after a flyby of Earth , two flybys of Venus , and six flybys of Mercury. [ 1 ] [ 6 ] The total cost of the mission was estimated in 2017 as US$2 billion. [ 7 ] Names [ edit ] BepiColombo is named after Giuseppe "Bepi" Colombo (1920–1984), a scientist , mathematician and engineer at the University of Padua , Italy , who first proposed the interplanetary gravity assist manoeuvre used by the 1974 Mariner 10 mission, a technique now used frequently by planetary probes. Mio , the name of the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter, was selected from thousands of suggestions by the Japanese public. In Japanese, Mio means a waterway, and according to JAXA, it symbolizes the research and development milestones reached thus far, and wishes for safe travel ahead. JAXA said the spacecraft will travel through the solar wind just like a ship traveling through the ocean. [ 5 ] In Chinese and Japanese, Mercury is known as the "water star" (水星) according to wǔxíng . Scientific objectives [ edit ] The main objectives of the mission are: [ 3 ] [ 8 ] Study the origin and evolution of a planet close to its parent star Study Mercury's form, interior, structure, geology, composition and craters Investigate Mercury's exosphere , composition and dynamics, including generation and escape Study Mercury's magnetised envelope ( magnetosphere ) – structure and dynamics Investigate the origin of Mercury's magnetic field Verify Einstein's theory of general relativity by measuring the parameters gamma and beta of the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism with high accuracy. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Mercury is too small and hot for its gravity to retain any significant atmosphere over long periods of time, but it has a "tenuous surface-bounded exosphere " [ 11 ] containing hydrogen , helium , oxygen , sodium , calcium , potassium and other trace elements. Its exosphere is not stable as atoms are continuously lost and replenished from a variety of sources. The mission will study the exosphere composition and dynamics, including generation and escape. The orbiters are equipped with scientific instruments provided by various European countries and Japan. The mission will characterize the solid and liquid iron core ( 3 ⁄ 4 of the planet's radius) and determine the size of each. [ 12 ] The mission will also complete gravitational and magnetic field mappings. Russia provided gamma ray and neutron spectrometers to verify the existence of water ice in polar craters that are permanently in shadow from the Sun's rays. Mission overview [ edit ] The mission involves three components, which will separate into independent spacecraft upon arrival at Mercury. [ 13 ] Mercury Transfer Module (MTM) for propulsion, built by ESA. Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) built by ESA. Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO) or Mio built by JAXA. During the launch and cruise phases, these three components are joined (with the Magnetospheric Orbiter Sunshield and Interface or MOSIF between Mio and MPO) [ 14 ] to form the Mercury Cruise System (MCS). [ 15 ] [ 16 ] The stacked spacecraft will take eight years to position itself to enter Mercury orbit. During this time it uses solar-electric propulsion and nine gravity assists, flying past the Earth and Moon in April 2020, Venus in 2020 and 2021, and six Mercury flybys between 2021 and 2025. [ 1 ] Expected to arrive in Mercury orbit in November 2026, the Mio and MPO satellites will separate and observe Mercury in collaboration for one year, with a possible one-year extension. [ 1 ] Although originally expected to enter orbit in December 2025, thruster issues discovered in September 2024 before the fourth Mercury flyby resulted in a delayed arrival of November 2026. [ 17 ] ESA is responsible for the overall mission, the design, development assembly and test of the propulsion and MPO modules, and the launch. The two orbiters are operated by mission controllers based in Darmstadt , Germany. [ 18 ] The spacecraft operations manager of BepiColombo was Elsa Montagnon until 2021, [ 19 ] and is now Ignacio Clerigo. [ 20 ] ESA's Cebreros, Spain 35-metre (115 ft) ground station is the primary ground facility for communications during all mission phases. [ 21 ] Mission timeline [ edit ] BepiColombo , imaged at Northolt Branch Observatories , 16 hours after the Earth flyby. The bright satellite passing by is INSAT-2D . Mercury on 23 June 2022 during the 2nd gravity assist at the planet Before launch [ edit ] The BepiColombo mission proposal was selected by ESA in 2000. A request for proposals for the science payload was issued in 2004. [ 22 ] In 2007, Astrium (now Airbus Defence and Space ) was selected as the prime contractor, [ 23 ] and Ariane 5 chosen as the launch vehicle . [ 22 ] The initial target launch of July 2014 was postponed several times, mostly because of delays on the development of the solar electric propulsion system. [ 22 ] The mission was approved in November 2009, after years in proposal and planning as part of the European Space Agency's Horizon 2000+ programme; [ 24 ] it is the last mission of the programme to be launched. [ 25 ] Launch [ edit ] The two orbiters were successfully launched together on 20 October 2018. [ 18 ] The launch took place on Ariane flight VA245 from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou , French Guiana. [ 26 ] Gravity assist maneuvers [ edit ] Mercury on 5 September 2024 during the 4th gravity assist at the planet The stacked spacecraft left Earth with a hyperbolic excess velocity of 3.475 km/s (2.159 mi/s). Initially, the craft was placed in a heliocentric orbit similar to that of Earth. After both the spacecraft and Earth completed one and a half orbits, it returned to Earth to perform a gravity-assist maneuver and was deflected towards Venus . [ 27 ] Following its Earth flyby in April 2020, BepiColombo was briefly mistaken for a near-Earth asteroid , receiving the provisional designation 2020 GL 2 . [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Two consecutive Venus flybys reduced the perihelion near to the Sun–Mercury distance with almost no need for thrust. A sequence of six Mercury flybys lowered the relative velocity to 1.76 km/s (1.09 mi/s). After the fourth Mercury flyby in 2024, the spacecraft is in an orbit similar to that of Mercury and remains in the general vicinity of the planet. [ 32 ] Science during Venus flybys [ edit ] After the potential biomarker phosphine has been tentatively discovered in the Venusian atmosphere in September 2020, ESA scientists suggested that BepiColombo might be able to detect the compound during its two Venus flybys in 2020 and 2021. However, it was not clear if the spacecraft's instruments were sufficiently sensitive [ 33 ] and there has been no announcement of such detection since. During the first Venus flyby in October 2020, seven science instruments and a radiation monitor onboard the Mercury Planetary Orbiter, and three instruments onboard Mio , were active and gathering data. The observations were coordinated with JAXA 's Akatsuki , the only active spacecraft orbiting Venus at that time, as well as Earth-based observatories. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] The second Venus flyby in August 2021 happened only 33 hours after another interplanetary spacecraft by ESA , Solar Orbiter , completed its gravity assist at the same planet. Both spacecraft used their science instruments to study the magnetic, plasma, and particle environment around Venus during their flybys, offering unique multipoint datasets. The MPO's MERTIS instrument captured high resolution spectra of the Venus atmosphere and the Mercury Transfer Module's three monitoring cameras (M-CAM) captured a series of black-and-white images of the planet, documenting the various phases of the flyby. [ 36 ] Science during Mercury flybys [ edit ] During the first Mercury flyby in October 2021, the spacecraft captured its first images of the target planet using the M-CAM monitoring cameras on the Mercury Transfer Module. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Some of the scientific instruments on both orbiters were also active during the flyby, exploring the magnetic and particle environment around Mercury and measuring the planet's gravity. [ 39 ] During the second flyby in June 2022, the M-CAM cameras imaged, among other targets, the crater Heaney with a candidate volcano, an important target for the spacecraft's primary mission. This crater has been recently named after Seamus Heaney following a request from the M-CAM team. Some of the scientific instruments have been again active, measuring the magnetic, plasma, and particle environment around the spacecraft. [ 40 ] During the third flyby in June 2023, the MPPE suite of instruments on Mio was used to map the magnetosphere of Mercury . [ 41 ] Based on these data, scientists described various expected features of the magnetosphere, but also made new discoveries: 1) a low latitude layer containing particles with much broader energy range than ever observed on Mercury, 2) energetic hydrogen ions trapped at low latitude and near the equator, and 3) cold plasma ions of oxygen and sodium , as well as signatures of potassium , which were probably ejected from the planet's surface by micrometeorites or the solar wind . [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Mio 's observations during this flyby also identified the chirping-like discrete whistler-mode emission waves previously observed in Earth's magnetosphere but so far unknown from Mercury. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] In May 2024, computers on BepiColombo (as well as on another ESA mission, Mars Express ) reported a sharp increase in the number of memory errors, coinciding with a massive solar flare from the active region AR3664 , at that time facing away from Earth. The event was also observed in detail by ESA's Solar Orbiter . [ 46 ] During the fourth flyby in September 2024, the spacecraft had, for the first time, a clear view of Mercury's south pole. The M-CAM 2 and 3 cameras provided images of the polar region, as well as the Vivaldi crater and a crater newly named Stoddart after Margaret Olrog Stoddart following a request from the M-CAM team. [ 47 ] During the fifth flyby in December 2024, using the MERTIS instrument, BepiColombo became the first spacecraft ever to observe Mercury in mid-infrared light. [ 48 ] During the sixth and final Mercury flyby in January 2025, the M-CAM 1 camera imaged the permanently shadowed craters Prokofiev, Kandinsky, Tolkien, and Gordimer near the planet's north pole. [ 49 ] Thruster issues [ edit ] On 15 May 2024, ESA reported an issue preventing the spacecraft's thrusters from operating at full power during a scheduled manoeuvre on 26 April 2024. [ 50 ] On 2 September 2024, ESA reported that to compensate for the reduced available thrust, a revised trajectory had been developed that would add 11 months to the cruise, delaying the expected arrival date from 5 December 2025 to November 2026. [ 51 ] Future [ edit ] Four final thrust arcs will reduce the relative velocity to the point where Mercury will "weakly" capture the spacecraft in November 2026 into polar orbit . Only a small maneuver is needed to bring the craft into an orbit around Mercury with an apocentre of 178,000 kilometres (111,000 mi). The orbiters then separate and will adjust their orbits using chemical thrusters. [ 52 ] [ 27 ] Trajectory [ edit ] As of January 2025 [update] , the mission schedule is: [ 53 ] Date Event Comment 20 October 2018, 01:45 UTC Launch 10 April 2020, 04:25 UTC Earth flyby 1.5 years after launch 15 October 2020, 03:58 UTC First Venus flyby On 15 October 2020, the ESA reported the flyby was a success.

Its role is to carry the two science orbiters to Mercury and to support them during the cruise. The MTM is equipped with a solar electric propulsion system as the main spacecraft propulsion. Its four QinetiQ -T6 ion thrusters operate singly or in pairs for a maximum combined thrust of 290 mN, [ 68 ] making it the most powerful ion engine array ever operated in space. The MTM supplies electrical power for the two hibernating orbiters as well as for its solar electric propulsion system thanks to two 14-metre-long (46 ft) solar panels . [ 69 ] Depending on the probe's distance to the Sun , the generated power will range between 7 and 14 kW, each T6 requiring between 2.5 and 4.5 kW according to the desired thrust level. The solar electric propulsion system has typically very high specific impulse and low thrust . This leads to a flight profile with months-long continuous low-thrust braking phases, interrupted by planetary gravity assists , to gradually reduce the velocity of the spacecraft. Moments before Mercury orbit insertion, the MTM will be jettisoned from the spacecraft stack. After separation from the MTM, the MPO will provide Mio all necessary power and data resources until Mio is delivered to its mission orbit. [ 70 ] Separation of Mio from MPO will be accomplished by spin-ejection. [ 71 ] MTM in space simulator MTM solar wing deployment MTM at ESTEC MTM thruster detail Mercury Planetary Orbiter [ edit ] The Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) has a mass of 1,150 kg (2,540 lb) and uses a single-sided solar array capable of providing up to 1000 watts and featuring Optical Solar Reflectors to keep its temperature below 200 °C (392 °F). The solar array requires continuous rotation keeping the Sun at a low incidence angle in order to generate adequate power while at the same time limiting the temperature. [ 69 ] The MPO carries a payload of 11 instruments, comprising cameras, spectrometers ( IR , UV , X-ray , γ-ray , neutron ), a radiometer, a laser altimeter, a magnetometer, particle analysers, a Ka-band transponder, and an accelerometer. The payload components are mounted on the nadir side of the spacecraft to achieve low detector temperatures, apart from the MERTIS and PHEBUS spectrometers located directly at the main radiator to provide a better field of view. [ 69 ] A high-temperature-resistant 1.0 m (3 ft 3 in) diameter high-gain antenna is mounted on a short boom on the zenith side of the spacecraft. Communications will be on the X-band and Ka-band with an average bit rate of 50 kbit/s and a total data volume of 1550 Gbit /year. ESA's Cebreros, Spain 35-metre (115 ft) ground station is planned to be the primary ground facility for communications during all mission phases.

[ 75 ] [ 76 ] Mercury Orbiter Radio-science Experiment (MORE), developed by Italy and the United States Probing of Hermean Exosphere by Ultraviolet Spectroscopy (PHEBUS), developed by France and Russia Search for Exosphere Refilling and Emitted Neutral Abundances (SERENA), [ 77 ] made up of 2 neutral and 2 ionised particle analysers: ELENA (Emitted Low-Energy Neutral Atoms) developed by Italy; STROFIO (STart from a ROtating Field mass spectrOmeter) developed by United States; [ 78 ] MIPA (Miniature Ion Precipitation Analyser) developed by Sweden; PICAM (Planetary Ion CAMera) developed by the Space Research Institute (Institut für Weltraumforschung, IWF), Russian Space Research Institute (IKI), Institut de recherche en sciences de l'environnement (CETP/IPSL), European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), Research Institute for Particle and Nuclear Physics (KFKI-RMKI) and the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS). [ 74 ] Spectrometers and Imagers for MPO BepiColombo Integrated Observatory System (SIMBIO-SYS), high resolution stereo cameras and a visual and near infrared spectrometer , developed by Italy, France and Switzerland Solar Intensity X-ray and Particle Spectrometer (SIXS), developed by Finland and United Kingdom. Mio (Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter) [ edit ] Mio , or the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO), developed and built mostly by Japan , has the shape of a short octagonal prism, 180 cm (71 in) long from face to face and 90 cm (35 in) high. [ 3 ] [ 79 ] It has a mass of 285 kg (628 lb), including a 45 kg (99 lb) scientific payload consisting of 5 instrument groups, 4 for plasma and dust measuring run by investigators from Japan, and one magnetometer from Austria . [ 3 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Mio will be spin stabilized at 15 rpm with the spin axis perpendicular to the equator of Mercury. It will enter a polar orbit at an altitude of 590 × 11,640 km (370 × 7,230 mi), outside of MPO's orbit. [ 80 ] The top and bottom of the octagon act as radiators with louvers for active temperature control. The sides are covered with solar cells which provide 90 watts. Communications with Earth will be through a 0.8 m (2 ft 7 in) diameter X-band phased array high-gain antenna and two medium-gain antennas operating in the X-band. Telemetry will return 160 Gb /year, about 5 kbit/s over the lifetime of the spacecraft, which is expected to be greater than one year. The reaction and control system is based on cold gas thrusters . After its release in Mercury orbit, Mio will be operated by Sagamihara Space Operation Center using Usuda Deep Space Center 's 64 m (210 ft) antenna located in Nagano, Japan . [ 72 ] Mio at ESTEC before stacking Mio being lifted from the container by a crane Mio on top of MPO (without sunshield) Science payload of Mio [ edit ] Mio carries five groups of science instruments with a total mass of 45 kg (99 lb): [ 3 ] [ 72 ] Mercury Plasma Particle Experiment (MPPE), studies the plasma and neutral particles from the planet, its magnetosphere , and the solar wind . It will employ these instruments: Mercury Electron Analyzers (MEA1 and MEA2) Mercury Ion Analyzer (MIA) Mass Spectrum Analyzer (MSA), developed by Laboratory of Plasma Physics (LPP), Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS), IDA of Technical University of Braunschweig and Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) [ 82 ] High-Energy Particle instrument for electrons (HEP-ele) High-Energy Particle instrument for Ions (HEP-ion) Energetic Neutrals Analyzer (ENA) Mercury Magnetometer (MMO-MGF), studies Mercury's magnetic field , magnetosphere, and interplanetary solar wind Plasma Wave Investigation (PWI), studies the electric field, electromagnetic waves, and radio waves from the magnetosphere and solar wind Mercury Sodium Atmosphere Spectral Imager (MSASI), studies the thin sodium atmosphere of Mercury Mercury Dust Monitor (MDM), studies dust from the planet and interplanetary space Magnetospheric Orbiter Sunshield and Interface [ edit ] Full stack with sunshield on top The Mio orbiter requires additional thermal control on the cruise to Mercury, in addition to umbilicals to the MPO. The European Space Agency thus provided the Magnetospheric Orbiter Sunshield and Interface (MOSIF), a white shroud that is shaped like a conical frustrum to provide clearance, as Mio is spun up during its separation in 2026, before being ejected from the MPO. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Mercury Surface Element (cancelled) [ edit ] The Mercury Surface Element (MSE) was cancelled in 2003 due to budgetary constraints. [ 25 ] At the time of cancellation, MSE was meant to be a small, 44 kg (97 lb), lander designed to operate for about one week on the surface of Mercury. [ 52 ] Shaped as a 0.9 m (2 ft 11 in) diameter disc, it was designed to land at a latitude of 85° near the terminator region. Braking manoeuvres would bring the lander to zero velocity at an altitude of 120 m (390 ft) at which point the propulsion unit would be ejected, airbags inflated, and the module would fall to the surface with a maximum impact velocity of 30 m/s (98 ft/s). Scientific data would be stored onboard and relayed via a cross-dipole UHF antenna to either the MPO or Mio . The MSE would have carried a 7 kg (15 lb) payload consisting of an imaging system (a descent camera and a surface camera), a heat flow and physical properties package, an alpha particle X-ray spectrometer , a magnetometer , a seismometer , a soil penetrating device (mole), and a micro- rover .

The data collected for this image, even though it was submitted to the Minor Planet Center as artificial satellite 2018-080A (BepiColombo's official designation), led to it being mistaken for a Near Earth asteroid. The "discovery", announced by the Minor Planet Center as asteroid 2020 GL2, was retracted soon after. This was the third time a spacecraft had been mistakenly announced as a "new asteroid" during an Earth flyby, after Rosetta a.k.a. 2007 VN84 and Gaia a.k.a. 2015 HP116.

Cosmic Vision ← CHEOPS Euclid → Living With a Star program ← Parker The Solar Orbiter (SolO) [ 7 ] is a Sun -observing probe developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) with a NASA contribution. Solar Orbiter, designed to obtain detailed measurements of the inner heliosphere and the nascent solar wind , also performs close observations of the polar regions of the Sun which is difficult to do from Earth. These observations are important in investigating how the Sun creates and controls its heliosphere . Solar Orbiter makes observations of the Sun from an eccentric orbit moving as close as ≈60 solar radii (R S ) , or 0.284 astronomical units (au) , placing it inside Mercury 's perihelion of 0.3075 au. [ 8 ] During the mission the orbital inclination will be raised to about 24°. The total mission cost is US$ 1.5 billion, counting both ESA and NASA contributions. [ 9 ] Solar Orbiter was launched on 10 February 2020 from Cape Canaveral , Florida, USA. The nominal mission is planned until the end of 2026, with a potential extension until 2030. [ 10 ] A comparison of the size of the Sun as seen from Earth (left, 1 au) and from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft (0.284 au, right) The Solar Orbiter structural thermal model shortly before leaving the Airbus Defence and Space facility in Stevenage, UK Solar Orbiter spacecraft is prepared for encapsulation in the United Launch Alliance Atlas V payload fairing. Mission overview [ edit ] During the initial cruise phase, which lasted until November 2021, Solar Orbiter performed two gravity-assist manoeuvres around Venus and one around Earth to alter the spacecraft's trajectory, guiding it towards the innermost regions of the Solar System . At the same time, Solar Orbiter acquired in situ data to characterise and calibrate its remote-sensing instruments. The first close solar pass took place on 26 March 2022 at around a third of Earth's distance from the Sun. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The spacecraft's orbit has been chosen to be in resonance with Venus , which means that it will return to the planet's vicinity every few orbits and can again use the planet's gravity to alter or tilt its orbit. Initially, Solar Orbiter was confined to the same orbital plane as the planets, but each encounter of Venus will increase its orbital inclination . For example, following the 2025 Venus encounter it makes solar passes at 17° inclination, increasing to 33° during a proposed mission extension phase, bringing even more of the polar regions into direct view. [ 11 ] The spacecraft makes a close approach to the Sun every six months. [ 3 ] The closest approaches are positioned to allow a repeated study of the same region of the solar atmosphere. Solar Orbiter is able to observe the magnetic activity building up in the atmosphere that can lead to powerful solar flares or eruptions. [ 13 ] Researchers also have the chance to coordinate observations with NASA 's Parker Solar Probe mission (2018–present) which is performing measurements of the Sun's extended corona , [ 14 ] [ 15 ] as well as other ground-based assets such as the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Objectives [ edit ] The objective of the mission is to perform close-up, high-resolution studies of the Sun and its inner heliosphere . The new understanding will help answer these questions: [ 18 ] How and where do the solar wind plasma and magnetic field originate in the corona ? [ 19 ] How do solar transients drive heliospheric variability? [ 20 ] How do solar eruptions produce energetic particle radiation that fills the heliosphere? [ 21 ] How does the solar dynamo work and drive connections between the Sun and the heliosphere? [ 22 ] Spacecraft [ edit ] The Solar Orbiter spacecraft is a Sun-pointed, three-axis stabilised platform with a dedicated heat shield to provide protection from the high levels of solar flux near perihelion . The 21 sensors were configured on the spacecraft to allow each to conduct its in-situ or remote-sensing experiments with both access to and protection from the solar environment. Solar Orbiter has inherited technology from previous missions, such as the solar arrays from ESA 's BepiColombo Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO). The solar arrays can be rotated about their longitudinal axis to avoid overheating when close to the Sun. A battery pack provides supplementary power at other points in the mission such as eclipse periods encountered during planetary flybys. [ 23 ] Communication [ edit ] The Telemetry, Tracking, and Command Subsystem provides the communication link capability with the Earth in X-band . The subsystem supports telemetry, telecommand and ranging. Low-gain antennas are used for Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) and function as a back-up during the mission phase when steerable medium- and high-gain antennas are in use. [ 23 ] The High-Temperature High-Gain Antenna needs to point to a wide range of positions to achieve a link with the ground station and to be able to downlink sufficient volumes of data. Its design was adapted from the BepiColombo mission. The antenna can be folded in to gain protection from Solar Orbiter's heat shield if necessary. Most data will therefore initially be stored in on-board memory and sent back to Earth at the earliest possible opportunity. [ 23 ] During nominal science operations, science data is downlinked for eight hours during each communication period with the ground station. Additional eight-hour downlink passes are scheduled as needed to reach the required total science data return of the mission. The Solar Orbiter ground segment makes maximum reuse of ESA's infrastructure for Deep Space missions: The ground stations, which belong to ESA's space tracking station network ( ESTRACK ) The Mission Operations Centre (MOC), located at ESOC , Darmstadt , Germany The Science Operations Centre (SOC), located at ESAC , Villanueva de la Cañada , Spain The communications network, linking the various remotely located centres and stations to support the operational data traffic [ 24 ] The Science Operations Centre was responsible for mission planning and the generation of payload operations requests to the MOC, as well as science data archiving. The SOC has been operational for the active science phase of the mission, i.e. from the beginning of the Cruise Phase onwards. The handover of payload operations from the MOC to the SOC is performed at the end of the Near-Earth Commissioning Phase (NECP). ESA's Malargüe Station in Argentina will be used for all operations throughout the mission, with the ground stations of New Norcia Station , Australia, and Cebreros Station , Spain, acting as backup when necessary. [ 24 ] [ 1 ] Instruments [ edit ] The flight model of the Electrostatic Analyser System (EAS), which is part of the Solar Wind Analyser (SWA) Suite The science payload is composed of 10 instruments: [ 25 ] Heliospheric in-situ instruments (4) [ edit ] STIX SWA – Solar Wind Plasma Analyser (United Kingdom): Consists of a suite of sensors that measures the ion and electron bulk properties (including density, velocity, and temperature) of the solar wind, thereby characterizing the solar wind between 0.28 and 1.4 au from the Sun. In addition to determining the bulk properties of the wind, SWA provides measurements of solar wind ion composition for key elements (e.g. the C, N, O group and Fe, Si or Mg) [ 4 ] [ 26 ] EPD – Energetic Particle Detector (Spain): Measures the composition, timing and distribution functions of suprathermal and energetic particles. Scientific topics to be addressed include the sources, acceleration mechanisms, and transport processes of these particles [ 4 ] MAG – Magnetometer (United Kingdom): Provides in situ measurements of the heliospheric magnetic field (up to 64 Hz) with high precision. This will facilitate detailed studies into the way the Sun's magnetic field links into space and evolves over the solar cycle; how particles are accelerated and propagate around the Solar System, including to the Earth; how the corona and solar wind are heated and accelerated [ 4 ] RPW – Radio and Plasma Waves (France): Unique amongst the Solar Orbiter instruments, RPW makes both in situ and remote-sensing measurements. RPW measures magnetic and electric fields at high time resolution using a number of sensors/antennas, to determine the characteristics of electromagnetic and electrostatic waves in the solar wind [ 4 ] Solar remote-sensing instruments (6) [ edit ] PHI – Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (Germany): Provides high-resolution and full-disk measurements of the photospheric vector magnetic field and line-of-sight (LOS) velocity as well as the continuum intensity in the visible wavelength range. The LOS velocity maps have the accuracy and stability to allow detailed helioseismic investigations of the solar interior, in particular of the solar convection zone high-resolution and full-disk measurements of the photospheric magnetic field [ 4 ] EUI – Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (Belgium): Images the solar atmospheric layers above the photosphere, thereby providing an indispensable link between the solar surface and outer corona that ultimately shapes the characteristics of the interplanetary medium. Also, EUI provides the first-ever UV images of the Sun from an out-of-ecliptic viewpoint (up to 33° of solar latitude during the extended mission phase) [ 4 ] SPICE – Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (France): Performs extreme ultraviolet imaging spectroscopy to remotely characterize plasma properties of the Sun's on-disk corona. This will enable matching in situ composition signatures of solar wind streams to their source regions on the Sun's surface [ 4 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] STIX – Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (Switzerland): Provides imaging spectroscopy of solar thermal and non-thermal X-ray emission from 4 to 150 keV. STIX provides quantitative information on the timing, location, intensity, and spectra of accelerated electrons as well as of high-temperature thermal plasmas, mostly associated with flares and/or microflares [ 4 ] Metis [ 29 ] – Coronagraph (Italy): Simultaneously images the visible and far ultraviolet emissions of the solar corona and diagnoses, with unprecedented temporal coverage and spatial resolution, the structure and dynamics of the full corona in the range from 1.4 to 3.0 (from 1.7 to 4.1) solar radii from Sun centre, at minimum (maximum) perihelion during the nominal mission. This is a region that is crucial in linking the solar atmospheric phenomena to their evolution in the inner heliosphere [ 4 ] SoloHI – Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager (United States): Images both the quasi-steady flow and transient disturbances in the solar wind over a wide field of view by observing visible sunlight scattered by solar wind electrons. SoloHI provides unique measurements to pinpoint coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

[ 37 ] In August 2017, Solar Orbiter was considered on track for a launch in February 2019. [ 38 ] The spacecraft is shipped to IABG in Germany to begin the environmental test campaign in September 2018. [ 39 ] Launch [ edit ] The Atlas V 411 (AV-087) lifted off from SLC-41 at Cape Canaveral , Florida, on 10 February 2020 at 04:03 UTC. The Solar Orbiter spacecraft separated from the Centaur upper stage nearly 53 minutes later, and ESA acquired the first signals from the spacecraft a few minutes later. [ 9 ] Cruise phase [ edit ] After launch, Solar Orbiter entered the crusie phase, which lasted until late 2021. [ 40 ] Using repeated gravity assists from Earth and Venus, the spacecraft reached its operational orbit, an elliptical orbit with perihelion 0.29 AU and aphelion 0.91 AU. The first flyby was of Venus in December 2020. [ 41 ] In June 2020, Solar Orbiter came within 77,000,000 km (48,000,000 mi) of the Sun, and captured the closest pictures of the Sun ever taken. [ 42 ] During its cruise towards Venus, Solar Orbiter passed through the ion tail of comet C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) from 31 May to 1 June 2020. It passed through the comet's dust tail on 6 June 2020. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] In December 2021, it flew through the tail of comet C/2021 A1 Leonard . [ 45 ] In August 2021, the second Venus flyby happened only 33 hours before another interplanetary spacecraft by ESA , BepiColombo , conducted its gravity assist at the same planet. Both spacecraft used their science instruments to study the magnetic, plasma, and particle environment around Venus during their flybys, offering unique multipoint datasets. Solar Orbiter's SoloHI imager observed the nightside of Venus, surrounded by a bright crescent of the dayside, in the days before closest approach. Solar Orbiter's magnetometer observed changes in Venus's magnetic environment along the trajectory, including a sharp drop as the spacecraft crossed the bow shock. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Nominal mission phase [ edit ] Over the expected mission duration of 7 years, Solar Orbiter will use additional gravity assists from Venus to raise its inclination from 0° to 24°, allowing it a better view of the Sun's poles. If an extended mission is approved, the inclination could rise further to 33°. [ 1 ] [ 49 ] 2022 [ edit ] The highest resolution image of the Sun's full disc and outer atmosphere, the corona, so far have been taken on 7 March 2022. [ 50 ] In September 2022, scientists suggested a solution to the magnetic switchback mystery based on Solar Orbiter data from March 2022. [ 51 ] Between 18 and 24 October 2022, the first coordinated observations of the Sun by Solar Orbiter and Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope were performed to demonstrate how such high-resolution joint observations can help address important scientific questions in the field. Coordinated data were successfully collected at several times throughout the week, enabling studies of coronal loop physics, the formation and evolution of small-scale active region brightenings, and coronal rain dynamics. [ 17 ] In 2022, Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) planners collaborated to study why the Sun's atmosphere is 150 times hotter than its surface. Solar Orbiter observed the Sun from 140 million kilometers, while PSP simultaneously observed the Sun's corona from nearly 9 million kilometers. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] 2024 [ edit ] In March 2024, both Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) were at their closest approaches to the Sun, PSP at 7.3 million km, and Solar Orbiter at 45 million km. Solar Orbiter observed the Sun, while PSP sampled the plasma of the solar wind , allowing scientists to compare data from both probes. [ 54 ] In mid-May 2024, the active sunspot region AR3664 caused the biggest solar storm to hit Earth in over 20 years. Solar Orbiter was able to observe the active region in late May, when it was facing away from Earth, and documented the strongest solar flare yet of solar cycle 25 on 20 May, followed by a surge of fast ions and electrons detected by the EPD instrument. After that, the spacecraft's Metis coronagraph observed a coronal mass ejection , whose effects on the spacecraft's environment were detected by the MAG magnetometer about one day later. The solar flare of 20 May was also detected by other ESA spacecraft, BepiColombo and Mars Express , as a large increase in the number of memory errors. [ 34 ] By combining the observations by Solar Orbiter and NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory , scientists were able to track the active region continuously for 94 days, i.e. over three solar rotations , creating the longest such series of observations so far. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] On 30 September 2024, at its ninth perihelion, Solar Orbiter observed a M7.7-class solar flare using EUI, PHI, SPICE, and STIX, which resulted in the most detailed recording of a large solar flare so far and allowed scientists to observe the build up of a "magnetic avalanche" just minutes before the flare. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] 2025 [ edit ] In February 2025, Solar Orbiter left the orbital plane of the solar system after successfully completing the 4th Venus flyby, [ 59 ] tilting its orbit to 17°. On 11 June 2025, the mission's first images and videos of the Sun's south pole (taken in March 2025) were released. These are the first images of the Sun's poles taken from outside the ecliptic plane. [ 60 ] In September 2025, scientists published CoSEE-Cat: A Comprehensive Solar Energetic Electron event Catalogue and identified two distinct types of solar energetic electrons , one associated with intense solar flares and other with coronal mass ejections , using in situ data from Solar Orbiter. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] In November 2025, scientists published first results based on the March 2025 observations of the Sun's south pole. The supergranulation data from the PHI and EUI instruments show that, contrary to expectations and previous ecliptic -plane observations, Sun's magnetic field drifts toward the poles at approximately 10 to 20 meters per second—almost as fast as it does at lower latitudes. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] 2026 [ edit ] ISRO and ESA conducted a workshop at IIST in Thiruvanthapuram between 19 and 23 January 2026 presenting data from Aditya-L1 , Proba-3 , and Solar Orbiter presenting complementary vantage data points from each mission.

The spacecraft was designed for astrometry : measuring the positions, distances and motions of stars with unprecedented precision, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and the positions of exoplanets by measuring attributes about the stars they orbit such as their apparent magnitude and color . [ 7 ] As of May 2025 [update] , the mission data processing continues, aiming to construct the largest and most precise 3D space catalog ever made, totalling approximately 1 billion astronomical objects , mainly stars, but also planets, comets, asteroids and quasars , among others. [ 8 ] To study the precise position and motion of its target objects, the spacecraft monitored each of them about 70 times [ 9 ] over the five years of the nominal mission (2014–2019), and about as many during its extension. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Due to its detectors degrading more slowly than initially expected, the mission was given an extension, [ 12 ] lasting until March 27, 2025, when scientists at the ESA switched off Gaia after more than a decade of service. [ 13 ] Gaia targeted objects brighter than magnitude 20 in a broad photometric band that covered the extended visual range between near-UV and near infrared; [ 14 ] such objects represent approximately 1% of the Milky Way population. [ 9 ] Additionally, Gaia was expected to detect thousands to tens of thousands of Jupiter-sized exoplanets beyond the Solar System by using the astrometry method, [ 15 ] [ 16 ] 500,000 quasars outside this galaxy and tens of thousands of known and new asteroids and comets within the Solar System. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] The Gaia mission continues to create a precise three-dimensional map of astronomical objects throughout the Milky Way and map their motions, which encode the origin and subsequent evolution of the Milky Way. The spectrophotometric measurements provide detailed physical properties of all stars observed, characterizing their luminosity , effective temperature , gravity and elemental composition. This massive stellar census is providing the basic observational data to analyze a wide range of important questions related to the origin, structure and evolutionary history of the Milky Way galaxy. The successor to the Hipparcos mission (operational 1989–1993), Gaia is part of ESA's Horizon 2000+ long-term scientific program. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 by Arianespace using a Soyuz ST-B / Fregat-MT rocket flying from Kourou in French Guiana. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] The spacecraft currently operates in a Lissajous orbit around the Sun – Earth L 2 Lagrangian point . The science observation officially ended on 15 January 2025. [ 22 ] History [ edit ] The Gaia space telescope had its roots in ESA's Hipparcos mission (1989–1993). Its mission was proposed in October 1993 by Lennart Lindegren ( Lund Observatory , Lund University , Sweden) and Michael Perryman (ESA) in response to a call for proposals for ESA's Horizon Plus long-term scientific programme. It was adopted by ESA's Science Programme Committee as cornerstone mission number 6 on 13 October 2000, and the B2 phase of the project was authorised on 9 February 2006, with EADS Astrium taking responsibility for the hardware. The name "Gaia" was originally derived as an acronym for Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics . This reflected the optical technique of interferometry that was originally planned for use on the spacecraft. While the working method evolved during studies and the acronym is no longer applicable, the name Gaia remained to provide continuity with the project. [ 23 ] The total cost of the mission is around €740 million (~ $1 billion), including the manufacture, launch and ground operations. [ 24 ] Gaia was completed two years behind schedule and 16% above its initial budget, mostly due to the difficulties encountered in polishing Gaia 's ten silicon carbide mirrors and assembling and testing the focal plane camera system. [ 25 ] Objectives [ edit ] The Gaia space mission has the following objectives: [ 26 ] [ 27 ] To determine the intrinsic luminosity of a star requires knowledge of its distance. One of the few ways to achieve this without physical assumptions is through the star's parallax , but atmospheric effects and instrumental biases degrade the precision of parallax measurements. For instance, Cepheid variables are used as standard candles to measure distances to galaxies, but their own distances are poorly known. Thus, quantities depending on them, such as the speed of expansion of the universe, remain inaccurate. Observations of the faintest objects will provide a more complete view of the stellar luminosity function. Gaia will observe 1 billion stars and other bodies, representing 1% of such bodies in the Milky Way galaxy. All objects up to a certain magnitude must be measured in order to have unbiased samples. To permit a better understanding of the more rapid stages of stellar evolution (such as the classification, frequency, correlations and directly observed attributes of rare fundamental changes and of cyclical changes). This has to be achieved by detailed examination and re-examination of a great number of objects over a long period of operation. Observing a large number of objects in the galaxy is also important to understand the dynamics of this galaxy. Measuring the astrometric and kinematic properties of a star is necessary in order to understand the various stellar populations, especially the most distant. Spacecraft [ edit ] Model of Gaia at Paris Air Show 2013 Gaia from different angle Gaia at its final phase of construction, 2013 Gaia was launched by Arianespace , using a Soyuz ST-B rocket with a Fregat-MT upper stage, from the Ensemble de Lancement Soyouz at Kourou in French Guiana on 19 December 2013 at 09:12 UTC (06:12 local time). The satellite separated from the rocket's upper stage 43 minutes after launch at 09:54 UTC. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The craft headed towards the Sun–Earth Lagrange point L2 located approximately 1.5 million kilometres from Earth, arriving there 8 January 2014. [ 30 ] The L2 point provides the spacecraft with a very stable gravitational and thermal environment. There, it uses a Lissajous orbit that avoids blockage of the Sun by the Earth, which would limit the amount of solar energy the satellite could produce through its solar panels , as well as disturb the spacecraft's thermal equilibrium. After launch, a 10-metre-diameter sunshade was deployed. The sunshade always maintains a fixed 45 degree angle to the Sun, while precessing to scan the sky, thus keeping all telescope components cool and powering Gaia using solar panels on its surface. These factors and the materials used in its creation allow Gaia to function in conditions between -170 ° C and 70 ° C. [ 31 ] Scientific instruments [ edit ] The Gaia payload consists of three main instruments: The astrometry instrument (Astro) precisely determines the positions of all stars brighter than magnitude 20 by measuring their angular position. [ 14 ] By combining the measurements of any given star over the duration of the mission, it will be possible to determine its parallax , and therefore its distance, and its proper motion —the velocity of the star projected on the plane of the sky. The photometric instrument (BP/RP) allows the acquisition of luminosity measurements of stars over the 320–1000 nm spectral band, of all stars brighter than magnitude 20. [ 14 ] The blue and red photometers (BP/RP) are used to determine stellar properties such as temperature, mass, age and elemental composition. [ 23 ] [ 32 ] Multi-colour photometry is provided by two low-resolution fused-silica prisms dispersing all the light entering the field of view in the along-scan direction prior to detection. The Blue Photometer (BP) operates in the wavelength range 330–680 nm; the Red Photometer (RP) covers the wavelength range 640–1050 nm. [ 33 ] The Radial-Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) is used to determine the velocity of celestial objects along the line of sight by acquiring high-resolution spectra in the spectral band 847–874 nm (field lines of calcium ion) for objects up to magnitude 17. Radial velocities are measured with a precision between 1 km/s (V=11.5) and 30 km/s (V=17.5). The measurements of radial velocities are important "to correct for perspective acceleration which is induced by the motion along the line of sight". [ 33 ] The RVS reveals the velocity of the star along the line of sight of Gaia by measuring the Doppler shift of absorption lines in a high-resolution spectrum. In order to maintain the fine pointing to focus on stars many light years away, the only moving parts are actuators to align the mirrors and the valves to fire the thrusters. It has no reaction wheels or gyroscopes. The spacecraft subsystems are mounted on a rigid silicon carbide [ 7 ] frame, which provides a stable structure that will not expand or contract due to temperature. Attitude control is provided by small cold gas thrusters that can output 1.5 micrograms of nitrogen per second. The telemetric link with the satellite is about 3 Mbit/s on average, while the total content of the focal plane represents several Gbit/s . [ 34 ] Therefore, only a few dozen pixels around each object can be downlinked.

[ 36 ] The spacecraft rotates continuously around an axis perpendicular to the two telescopes' lines of sight, with a spin period of 6 hours. Thus, every 6 hours the spacecraft scans a great circle stripe approximately 0.7 degrees wide. The spin axis in turn has a slower precession across the sky: it maintains a fixed 45 degree angle to the Sun, but follows a cone around the Sun every 63 days, giving a cycloid-like path relative to the stars.  Over the course of the mission, each star is scanned many times at various scan directions, providing interlocking measurements over the full sky. The two key telescope properties are: 1.45 × 0.5 m primary mirror for each telescope 1.0 × 0.5 m focal plane array on which light from both telescopes is projected. This in turn consists of 106 CCDs of 4500 × 1966 pixels each, for a total of 937.8 megapixels (commonly depicted as a gigapixel -class imaging device). [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 31 ] Each celestial object was observed on average about 70 times during the five years of the nominal mission, which has been extended to approximately ten years and will thus obtain twice as many observations. [ 40 ] These measurements will help determine the astrometric parameters of stars: two corresponding to the angular position of a given star on the sky, two for the derivatives of the star's position over time (motion) and lastly, the star's parallax from which distance can be calculated. The radial velocity of the brighter stars is measured by an integrated spectrometer observing the Doppler effect . Because of the physical constraints imposed by the Soyuz spacecraft, Gaia 's focal arrays could not be equipped with optimal radiation shielding, and ESA expected their performance to suffer somewhat toward the end of the initial five-year mission. Ground tests of the CCDs while they were subjected to radiation provided reassurance that the primary mission's objectives can be met. [ 41 ] An atomic clock on board Gaia plays a crucial role in achieving the mission's primary objectives. Gaia rotates with angular velocity of 60"/sec or 0.6 microarcseconds in 10 nanoseconds. Therefore, in order to meet its positioning goals, Gaia must be able to record the exact time of observation to within nanoseconds. Furthermore, no systematic positioning errors over the rotational period of 6 hours should be introduced by the clock performance. For the timing error to be below 10 nanoseconds over each rotational period, the frequency stability of the on-board clock needs to be better than 10 −12 . The rubidium atomic clock aboard the Gaia spacecraft has a stability reaching ~ 10 −13 over each rotational period of 21600 seconds. [ 42 ] Gaia' s measurements contribute to the creation and maintenance of a high-precision celestial reference frame, the Barycentric Celestial Reference System (BCRS) , which is essential for both astronomy and navigation. This reference frame serves as a fundamental grid for positioning celestial objects in the sky, aiding astronomers in various research endeavors. All observations, regardless of the actual positioning of the spacecraft, must be expressed in terms of this reference system. As a fully relativistic model, the influence of the gravitational field of the solar-system must be taken into account, including such factors as the gravitational light-bending due to the Sun, the major planets and the Moon. [ 43 ] The expected accuracies of the final catalogue data have been calculated following in-orbit testing, taking into account the issues of stray light, degradation of the optics, and the basic angle instability. The best accuracies for parallax, position and proper motion are obtained for the brighter observed stars, apparent magnitudes 3–12. The standard deviation for these stars is expected to be 6.7 micro-arcseconds or better. For fainter stars, error levels increase, reaching 26.6 micro-arcseconds error in the parallax for 15th-magnitude stars, and several hundred micro-arcseconds for 20th-magnitude stars. [ 44 ] For comparison, the best parallax error levels from the new Hipparcos reduction are no better than 100 micro-arcseconds, with typical levels several times larger. [ 45 ] Launch and orbit [ edit ] Animation of Gaia's trajectory Polar view Equatorial view Viewed from the Sun Gaia · Earth Simplified illustration of Gaia 's trajectory and orbit (not to scale) In October 2013 ESA had to postpone Gaia 's original launch date, due to a precautionary replacement of two of Gaia 's transponders. These are used to generate timing signals for the downlink of science data. A problem with an identical transponder on a satellite already in orbit motivated their replacement and reverification once incorporated into Gaia . The rescheduled launch window was from 17 December 2013 to 5 January 2014, with Gaia slated for launch on 19 December. [ 46 ] Gaia was successfully launched on 19 December 2013 at 09:12 UTC . [ 47 ] About three weeks after launch, on 8 January 2014, it reached its designated orbit around the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrange point (SEL2), [ 4 ] [ 48 ] about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. In 2015, the Pan-STARRS observatory discovered an object orbiting the Earth, which the Minor Planet Center catalogued as object 2015 HP 116 . It was soon found to be an accidental rediscovery of the Gaia spacecraft and the designation was promptly retracted. [ 49 ] Issues [ edit ] Stray light problem [ edit ] Shortly after launch, ESA revealed that Gaia suffers from a stray light problem. The problem was initially thought to be due to ice deposits reflecting some of the light diffracted around the edges of the sunshield into the telescope apertures and on towards the focal plane. [ 50 ] The actual source of the stray light was later identified as the fibers of the sunshield, protruding beyond the edges of the shield. [ 51 ] This results in a "degradation in science performance [which] will be relatively modest and mostly restricted to the faintest of Gaia 's one billion stars." Mitigation schemes were implemented [ 52 ] to improve performance. The degradation is more severe for the RVS spectrograph than for the astrometry measurements, because it spreads the light of the star onto a much larger number of detector pixels, each of which collects scattered light. This kind of problem has some historical background. In 1985 on STS-51-F , the Space Shuttle Spacelab -2 mission, another astronomical mission hampered by stray debris was the Infrared Telescope (IRT), in which a piece of mylar insulation broke loose and floated into the line-of-sight of the telescope causing corrupted data. [ 53 ] The testing of stray-light and baffles is a noted part of space imaging instruments. [ 54 ] Micrometeoroid hit [ edit ] In April 2024, a micrometeoroid hit and damaged Gaia's protective cover, creating "a little gap that allowed stray sunlight – around one billionth of the intensity of direct sunlight felt on Earth – to occasionally disrupt Gaia ’s very sensitive sensors". In May, the electronics of one of the CCDs failed, which caused a high rate of false detections. After that, the engineers refocused Gaia' s optics "for the final time". [ 55 ] Mission progress [ edit ] Gaia map of the sky by star density The testing and calibration phase, which started while Gaia was en route to SEL2 point, continued until the end of July 2014, [ 56 ] three months behind schedule due to unforeseen issues with stray light entering the detector. After the six-month commissioning period, the satellite started its nominal five-year period of scientific operations on 25 July 2014 using a special scanning mode that intensively scanned the region near the ecliptic poles ; on 21 August 2014 Gaia began using its normal scanning mode which provides more uniform coverage. [ 57 ] Although it was originally planned to limit Gaia ' s observations to stars fainter than magnitude 5.7, tests carried out during the commissioning phase indicated that Gaia could autonomously identify stars as bright as magnitude 3. When Gaia entered regular scientific operations in July 2014, it was configured to routinely process stars in the magnitude range 3 – 20. [ 58 ] On the bright side of that limit, special operational procedures download raw scanning data for the remaining 230 stars brighter than magnitude 3; methods to reduce and analyse these data are being developed; and it is expected that there will be "complete sky coverage at the bright end" with standard errors of "a few dozen μas". [ 59 ] On 30 August 2014, Gaia discovered its first supernova in another galaxy. [ 60 ] On 3 July 2015, a map of the Milky Way by star density was released, based on data from the spacecraft. [ 61 ] As of August 2016, "more than 50 billion focal plane transits, 110 billion photometric observations and 9.4 billion spectroscopic observations have been successfully processed." [ 62 ] In 2018 the Gaia mission was extended to 2020, and in 2020 it was further extended through 2022, with an additional "indicative extension" extending through 2025. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] The limiting factor to further mission extensions is the supply of nitrogen for the cold gas thrusters of the micro-propulsion system. [ 65 ] The amount of dinitrogen tetroxide (NTO) and monomethylhydrazine (MMH) for the chemical propulsion subsystem on board might have been enough to stabilize the spacecraft at L2 for several decades. Without the cold gas, though, the space craft could no longer be pointed on a microarcsecond scale. In March 2023, the Gaia mission was extended through the second quarter of 2025, when the spacecraft was expected to run out of cold gas propellant. [ 66 ] End of mission [ edit ] Gaia' s last targeted observation was done on 10 January 2025. [ 67 ] After several weeks of onboard technology tests, Gaia left its orbit near L 2 and was put into a heliocentric orbit away from Earth's sphere of influence . [ 68 ] After downlinking all remaining data to Earth, Gaia was decommissioned and passivated on 27 March 2025. [ 67 ] [ 69 ] The mission has since entered a post-operations phase to complete and publish the final Gaia Data Release, DR5, by the end of 2030. [ 66 ] Data releases [ edit ] Main article: Gaia catalogues Several Gaia catalogues are released over the years each time with increasing amounts of information and better astrometry; the early releases also miss some stars, especially fainter stars located in dense star fields and members of close binary pairs. [ 70 ] The first data release, Gaia DR1, based on 14 months of observation was on 14 September 2016. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] The data release includes "positions and ... magnitudes for 1.1 billion stars using only Gaia data; positions, parallaxes and proper motions for more than 2 million stars" based on a combination of Gaia and Tycho-2 data for those objects in both catalogues; "light curves and characteristics for about 3,000 variable stars; and positions and magnitudes for more than 2000 ... extragalactic sources used to define the celestial reference frame ". [ 70 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] The second data release (DR2), which occurred on 25 April 2018, [ 8 ] [ 76 ] is based on 22 months of observations made between 25 July 2014 and 23 May 2016. It includes positions, parallaxes and proper motions for about 1.3 billion stars and positions of an additional 300 million stars in the magnitude range g = 3–20, [ 77 ] red and blue photometric data for about 1.1 billion stars and single colour photometry for an additional 400 million stars, and median radial velocities for about 7 million stars between magnitude 4 and 13. It also contains data for over 14,000 selected Solar System objects. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] Stars and other objects in Gaia Early Data Release 3 Due to uncertainties in the data pipeline, the third data release, based on 34 months of observations, was split into two parts so that data that was ready first, was released first. The first part, EDR3 ("Early Data Release 3"), consisting of improved positions, parallaxes and proper motions, was released on 3 December 2020. [ 80 ] The coordinates in EDR3 use a new version of the Gaia celestial reference frame ( Gaia –CRF3), based on observations of 1,614,173 extragalactic sources, [ 80 ] 2,269 of which were common to radio sources in the third revision of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3) . [ 81 ] Included is the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars (GCNS), containing 331,312 stars within (nominally) 100 parsecs (330 light-years). [ 82 ] [ 83 ] The full DR3, published on 13 June 2022, includes the EDR3 data plus Solar System data; variability information; results for non-single stars, for quasars, and for extended objects; astrophysical parameters; and a special data set, the Gaia Andromeda Photometric Survey (GAPS). [ 84 ] Between DR3 and DR4 there was a Focused Product Release, publishing among other things new data on the Omega Centauri cluster using a novel observation technique; the technique will be extended to all globular clusters and other dense fields in future full Data Releases. Future releases [ edit ] The full data release for the five-year nominal mission, DR4, will include full astrometric, photometric and radial-velocity catalogues, variable-star and non-single-star solutions, source classifications plus multiple astrophysical parameters for stars, unresolved binaries, galaxies and quasars, an exo-planet list and epoch and transit data for all sources. [ 85 ] Additional release(s) will take place depending on mission extensions. [ 70 ] Most measurements in DR4 are expected to be 1.7 times more precise than DR2; proper motions will be 4.5 times more precise. [ 86 ] DR4 is expected to be released no earlier than December 2026. [ 70 ] The final Gaia catalogue, DR5, will consist of all data collected during the lifespan of the mission. It will be 1.4 times more precise than DR4, while proper motions will be 2.8 times more precise than DR4. [ 86 ] It will be published no earlier than the end of 2030. [ 70 ] All data of all catalogues will be available in an online data base that is free to use. An outreach application, Gaia Sky , has been developed to explore the galaxy in three dimensions using Gaia data. [ 87 ] Data processing [ edit ] VST snaps Gaia en route to a billion stars [ 88 ] The overall data volume that was retrieved from the spacecraft during the nominal five-year mission at a compressed data rate of 1 Mbit/s is approximately 60 TB , amounting to about 200 TB of usable uncompressed data on the ground, stored in an InterSystems Caché database. The responsibility of the data processing, partly funded by ESA, is entrusted to a European consortium, the Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC), which was selected after its proposal to the ESA Announcement of Opportunity released in November 2006. DPAC's funding is provided by the participating countries and has been secured until the production of Gaia 's final catalogue. [ 89 ] Gaia sends back data for about eight hours every day at about 5 Mbit/s. ESA's three 35-metre-diameter radio dishes of the ESTRACK network in Cebreros , Spain, Malargüe , Argentina and New Norcia , Australia, receive the data. [ 23 ] Significant results [ edit ] In July 2017, the Gaia–ESO Survey reported using Gaia data to find double-, triple-, and quadruple- stars. Using advanced techniques they identified 342 binary candidates, 11 triple candidates, and 1 quadruple candidate. Nine of these had been identified by other means, thus confirming that the technique can correctly identify multiple star systems. [ 90 ] The possible quadruple star system is HD 74438 , which was, in a paper published in 2022, identified as a possible progenitor of a sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernovae . [ 91 ] In November 2017, scientists led by Davide Massari of the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute , University of Groningen , Netherlands released a paper [ 92 ] describing the characterization of proper motion (3D) within the Sculptor dwarf galaxy , and of that galaxy's trajectory through space and with respect to the Milky Way , using data from Gaia and the Hubble Space Telescope . Massari said, "With the precision achieved we can measure the yearly motion of a star on the sky which corresponds to less than the size of a pinhead on the Moon as seen from Earth." The data showed that Sculptor orbits the Milky Way in a highly elliptical orbit; it is currently near its closest approach at a distance of about 83.4 kiloparsecs (272,000 ly), but the orbit can take it out to around 222 kiloparsecs (720,000 ly) distant. In October 2018, Leiden University astronomers were able to determine the orbits of 20  hyperrunaway star candidates from the DR2 dataset. Expecting to find a single star exiting the Milky Way , they instead found seven. More surprisingly, the team found that 13 hyperrunaway stars were instead approaching the Milky Way, possibly originating from as-of-yet unknown extragalactic sources. Alternatively, they could be halo stars to this galaxy, and further spectroscopic studies will help determine which scenario is more likely. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Independent measurements have demonstrated that the greatest Gaia radial velocity among the hyperrunaway stars is contaminated by light from nearby bright stars in a crowded field and cast doubt on the high Gaia radial velocities of other hypervelocity stars. [ 95 ] In late October 2018, the galactic population Gaia-Enceladus , the remains of a major merger with the defunct Enceladus dwarf, was discovered. [ 96 ] This system is associated with at least 13 globular clusters, and the creation of the Thick Disk of the Milky Way. It represents a significant merger about 10 billion years ago in the Milky Way Galaxy. [ 97 ] Gaia's HR Diagram In November 2018, the galaxy Antlia 2 was discovered. It is similar in size to the Large Magellanic Cloud , despite being 10,000 times fainter. Antlia 2 has the lowest surface brightness of any galaxy discovered. [ 98 ] In December 2019 the star cluster Price-Whelan 1 was discovered. [ 99 ] The cluster belongs to the Magellanic Clouds and is located in the leading arm of these Dwarf Galaxies . The discovery suggests that the stream of gas extending from the Magellanic Clouds to the Milky Way is about half as far from the Milky Way as previously thought. [ 100 ] The Radcliffe wave was discovered in data measured by Gaia , published in January 2020. [ 101 ] [ 102 ] In November 2020, Gaia measured the acceleration of the solar system towards the galactic center as 0.23 nanometers/s 2 . [ 103 ] [ 104 ] In March 2021, the European Space Agency announced that Gaia had identified a transiting exoplanet for the first time. The planet was discovered orbiting solar-type star Gaia EDR3 3026325426682637824. Following its initial discovery, the PEPSI spectrograph from the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) in Arizona was used to confirm the discovery and categorise it as a Jovian planet, a gas planet composed of hydrogen and helium gas. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] In May 2022, the confirmation of this exoplanet, designated Gaia-1b , was formally published, along with a second planet, Gaia-2b . [ 107 ] Based on its data, Gaia's Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (HR diagram) is one of the most accurate ones ever produced of the Milky Way Galaxy. [ 108 ] Analysis of Gaia DR3 data in 2022 revealed a Sun-like star with the identifier Gaia DR3 4373465352415301632 orbiting a black hole , dubbed Gaia BH1 . At a distance of roughly 1,600 light-years (490 pc), it is the closest known black hole to Earth. [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Another system with a red giant orbiting a black hole, Gaia BH2 , was also discovered. [ 111 ] In September 2023, radial velocity observations were used to confirm an exoplanet orbiting the star HIP 66074 that was first detected in Gaia DR3 astrometry data. This planet, known as HIP 66074 b or Gaia-3b, is the third Gaia exoplanet discovery to be confirmed and the first such discovery made using astrometry. [ 112 ] In addition, another exoplanet was discovered from a gravitational microlensing event observed by Gaia, Gaia22dkv . The host star is brighter than that of any exoplanet previously detected by microlensing, potentially making the planet detectable by radial velocity as well. [ 113 ] In March 2024, Gaia discovered two streams of stars, named by researchers Shakti and Shiva, that formed more than 12 billion years ago. [ 114 ] In 2025 a detailed 3D map of dust distribution within the Milky Way was constructed using data from Gaia and LAMOST spectral survey and machine learning. [ 115 ] GaiaNIR [ edit ] GaiaNIR (Gaia Near Infra-Red) is a proposed successor of Gaia in the near-infrared . [ 116 ] The mission would enlarge the current catalog with sources that are only (or better) visible in the near-infrared, at the cost of less precise measurements than an equivalent visible-light mission due to the broader diffraction pattern at longer wavelengths. It would at the same time improve the star parallax and particularly proper motion accuracy by revisiting the sources of the Gaia catalog. [ 117 ] One of the main challenges in building GaiaNIR is the low technology readiness level of near-infrared time delay and integration detectors but recent progress with Avalanche photodiode detectors (APDs) is overcoming this. In a 2017 ESA report two alternative concepts using conventional near-infrared detectors and de-spin mirrors were proposed but even without the development of NIR TDI detectors the technological challenge will likely increase the cost over an ESA M-class mission and might need shared cost with other space agencies. [ 117 ] One possible partnership with US institutions was proposed. [ 118 ] Since then the European Space Agency Science Programme Voyage 2050 has selected the theme of "Galactic Ecosystem with Astrometry in the Near-infrared" as one of two potential L-class missions to be implemented in the coming years thus boosting the chances for GaiaNIR which proposes exactly this.
